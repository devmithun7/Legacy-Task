"feelings, barely sleep, worthless, contemplate suicide, fix my issues, change my feeling of being worthless",If everyone thinks youre worthless then maybe you need to find new people to hang out withSeriously the social context in which a person lives is a big influence in selfesteemOtherwise you can go round and round trying to understand why youre not worthless then go back to the same crowd and be knocked down againThere are many inspirational messages you can find in social media  Maybe read some of the ones which state that no person is worthless and that everyone has a good purpose to their lifeAlso since our culture is so saturated with the belief that if someone doesnt feel good about themselves that this is somehow terribleBad feelings are part of living  They are the motivation to remove ourselves from situations and relationships which do us more harm than goodBad feelings do feel terrible   Your feeling of worthlessness may be good in the sense of motivating you to find out that you are much better than your feelings today
"sexual abuse, breast cancer survivor, insomniac, depression, anxiety, low self esteem, happily married, counseling",Let me start by saying there are never too many concerns that you can bring into counselling In fact most people who come to see me for counselling have more than one issue they would like to work on in psychotherapy and most times these are all interconnected In counselling we work together collaboratively to figure out which issues you would like to address first and then together we develop an individualized plan of care Basically its like a road map of where you want to go how are you going to get there looking at stopovers some scenic routes others possibly not so scenic however necessary Of course these plans can also change due to internal what we have control over like our thoughts feelings and behaviours or external reasons those things that are outside our control I would encourage you to take the next step and reach out to a professional you can trust and build rapport with by cojourneying through whatever concerns you have by examining what has been working so far as you have learned to cope with some of your issues like insomnia depression and anxiety as well as being a breast cancer survivor Then to help you by developing new coping strategies Psychotherapy can be such a powerful tool to help you get to where it is you want to be I know you can do it and you will see firsthand how psychotherapy will help you to move past these points in your life where you are feeling stuck I like to quote Nike where their motto is just do it You can do it
"feeling down, trouble sleeping, panic attacks, triggered, something, month, almost never",Answers about our inner lives are most successfully reached from a sense of feeling grounded in oneselfFirst step is to accept your nervousness and restless sleep  As often as possible sleep during daytimes in order for your body to catch up on its need for restAccept too about feeling down  It is normal to feel down once in a while  From this place of selfacceptance trust any answers which come up to your mind  Often answers about complicated topics come in small pieces not all at once as a whole unitAlso your description about panic attacks is also completely normal   They often arise unrelated to particular conditions at a given moment  They are a healthy symptom your body is trying to expel bad feelings and does this by having the anxiety erupt at timesSo selfacceptance tolerance of being on a process of clearing out worn out emotional clutter and sleep at odd times if possible are all ways to stabilize yourself which will also feel calm and good
"severe depression, anxiety, going through a lot, distracts me, cant get my mind off, bothering me, overcome anxiety, overcome depression",Have you used meditation or hypnosis Relaxing the mind and connecting with your true self is a great way to calm your thoughts and get to peace and calm Hypnosis and meditation have helped a lot of people with anxiety and depression Google hypnotherapists near me or write for a while about what is going on
"content, day to day",Your question is a fascinating oneAs humans we have the ability to reflect on situations in our livesEven if nothing currently goes on in a particular moment its possible youre reflecting on a serious or upsetting matterAnd our emotions linger within usJust because a particular moment feels calm inside your feelings may be the sense of a strong unsettled emotion from the recent pastGood for you to be aware of your own sensitivity to living with awareness of your moods and thoughts
"severe back problem, major operations, minor operations, constant pain, deal with depression, chronic pain",Chronic pain at the back likely results from a few areasL4L5 kidney zone most likely lower backBone spurs fused discs and slipped discs caused by connective tissue weakness and calcium deposits used to neutralize highly acidic areasThe depression will evaporate when the chronic pain is drained out through natural meansPharmaceutical means will simply extend the pain and cause it to deepen over time not solving the problemRemember medical doctors suppress natural doctors cure
"ADHD, anxiety disorder, depression, difficult to find a doctor, primary physician won't help, unemployed, overwhelmed.",If it is simply counseling that you seek any number of faithbased outfits are very willing to listen and help out with these sorts of matters free of charge Online messaging and social media is a secondary option however this one may come with privacy concerns and consequencesIf it were I I would attempt to sweettalk one or two counselors I come across to do a bit of work for folks who cant afford it
"lost erection, frequent problem, major problems, ego, self esteem, depression, tearing apart marriage, devastated, cannot find cause, attracted to wife, express in bedroom, causing issue, what can I do",First step always is to do a medical rule out so that youre sure the problem is psychological and emotion based not a medical condition which requires care and attentionIf you are medically clear in the reasons for losing your erection then reflect on what may be creating a loss in confidence in either who you are and what youre doing with your life or whether your wife has these sort of problems within herselfOften a problem transfers ownership of who shows itIf you are a sensitive person its possible your erection problem reflects your wifes insecurities and selfdoubt  If she is someone who is reluctant to talk about feeling unsure then in a certain way by you showing a problem she can avoid looking at herselfThere may not be a direct cause such as usually exists in a medical problemMedicine looks for symptoms to treatOur emotional lives are much more indirectIf you feel stress at work or are unhappy in the place you live for example then your frustration may show up in your sex lifeBasically do a broad inward search of your life and what it holds and maybe ask your wife to do the sameYou may clear the air within yourselves and between each other so the problem goes away
"depression, mood swings, intense, highs, lows, lack of focus, dark outlook, balanced life",Its fun to ride the roller coaster from time to time isnt it But its also wearymaking and leads to drainage that no man or woman can hardly anticipateBalance comes with proper understanding of the different bodies you possess and how they functionAnd to begin we focus upon your physical and move right up the latter to the spiritual and begin cleaning you outUnbalance is an experience of blocked energies that should be naturally flowing call them what thou mayest when blockages are removed what is naturally there flows and flows beautifully
"selfharm, stop for awhile, sad, depressing, automatically want to selfharm",In a way selfharm can present somewhat like an addiction  According to new research within the field of neuroscience there is a valid explanation for this  When a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better  If a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form addiction that would utilize this new behavior  Another way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens a positive reward for a behavior even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences  Consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes in this case sadness or depression and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist and working to extinguish the unwanted behavior   Someone who is trained in Dialectic Behavior Therapy andor Interpersonal Neurobiology would most likely have the skills and means available to address this with you
"general anxiety, depression, diagnosed, emotional support dog, prescription, paper work, apartment manager, disabled",This can be a difficult situation  Typically only animals that are specifically trains to accomplish a specific task are legally protected as Service Animsls Even though that can be very helpful emotional support animals are not generally protected in the same wayYou might not be able to make your landlord accommodate you If possible you may want to consider a different apparent that is more animal friendly
"depressed, ignored, sad, exaggerate, want to be sad, take me seriously",Ouch Its really hard to deal with a spouse that isnt taking you seriously In this case I would plan for and schedule a time to talk with him about this I would tell him that you need about 30 minutes to talk to him with minimal interruptions about something that is important to you Schedule a time write notes if you need reminders about what you need to express and tell him how you feel Ideally you would focus more on Istatements instead of telling him what he is doing wrong For example  I feel ignored vs You always ignore me By focusing on how you feel he is less likely to feel attacked and get defensive Some people go to couples or marriage counseling for help with communication Chances are there are things that BOTH of you do that hurts your communication Overall try to talk to him directly and try not to get defensive If he continues to say youre always sad  then stay calm say okay can you help me understand that more or Thats interesting Tell me what you see  Reach out to a couples counselor for more help with communication strategies Sometimes a 3rd party can help you both see things in a different perspective Hope this helps
"being sad, feel that way, sad music, tragic stories, bad, negative aspects, make it seem negative",It sounds like you are noticing that you are drawn towards sad and negative content and its hard to understand why This may sound counterintuitive but sometimes we do things that on the surface may look problematic or even cause us some real problems because it serves us in some unseen way A simple example would be somebody who is addicted to a substance their addiction may be causing serious problems in their life and they may even know it but the addiction serves them by helping them to avoid painful feelings that they anticipate having if they quit using Now I am not saying that what you describe is an addiction it is just a really illustrative example of the unseen benefitOne thing I would be wondering about is what is the unseen benefit of seeking out sad and negative content Id also be wondering what your relationship is to other feelings These are things you may benefit from exploring with a competent therapist
"sad, weather, fight",Seasonal Affective Disorder SAD is a term that reflects how many people are affected by the changing seasons especially fall to winter  Everyone suffers with some form of this lessened activity levels increased isolation etc while some find that this time of year can put them into a deeper depression If you have noticed that this happens frequently there are some ways you can definitely help yourself going forward1 Attend therapy to learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood  Its important to stay within the therapy until you feel you have mastered these tools 2 Push yourself to interact more with your social groups and other positive activities Its easy to go out and spend the day outside in the summer months when the temperature is warm and the sun shines for long periods of the day but it seems harder to find fun ways to spend your time when the temperature drops and darkness comes on so quickly  Perhaps winter time could become the time of year where you and your friends have weekly board game nights complete with hot chocolate and a fire3 You may want to consider the purchase of a SAD Light  These are lights that expose you to additional ultra violet light to increase the vitamin D in our bodies as well as the release of growth hormone which releases when we wake up There are mixed reviews of these products however and they can be expensive
"divorce, angry, overwhelmed, tired, joyless, out of control, sad, depressed, mid50s, job, handle",Going through a divorce is often a very low point for the people involvedAre you surprised that your soon to be ex doesnt help with your teenage daughterUsually patterns and dynamics in parenting are not  sudden developmentsIs it possible that what youre feeling now is more intensity to the stress of parenting by yourself not that this is a sudden problemThis is relevant because you may be more familiar and more capable than youre giving yourself credit  The lack of emotional support is definitely stressfulYour parenting skills may still be at the level at which they were prior to the divorceTake your emotional weariness seriously and reflect on the various ways of stress relief which are available and interest youGive yourself extra time to rest nurture yourself and be flexible in finding what feels right for stabilizing yourselfSince you talk about your daughter and help in physical ways if it is a matter of strength that you need talk with your attorney so that the child custody agreement includes whatever is physically necessary in the way of strength in taking care of your daughterThe Courts are very good at making effort that the custody agreement offers proper care to the kids
"confusion, distraction, unfocused, lack of accomplishments, disappointment, stuck",If you are a peoplepleaser type or a natural caretaker you can slowly lose yourself over time if you are always tending to the needs of others and neglecting yourself  If this sounds like a familiar pattern for you this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot  Maybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to take care of everything because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothly Over time a person who grows up in this type of environment learns that you put the needs of others before your own  You might also be stuck in these types of patterns in intimate relationships as well if you completely give yourself over to your significant other and you dont create a life for yourself with your own interests and supportive friends you are at risk of losing what is unique and amazing about you  If you grew up in a family where you learned this role out of survival or because it was needed to take care of your family its easy to recreate this in adult relationshipsIn both scenarios if there is no awareness that this self sacrifice at the expense of others is going on your identity is shaped around being a caretakerenablerpeoplepleaser and down the road it can lead to depression low self esteem and a confused sense of self  Basically you spend so much time helping other people that you dont make time for yourself or create a life of fulfillment  Before you realize it you have been living a life for others instead of yourself and you have no idea who YOU are  Supporting loved ones and friends is important and certainly admirable but if you are always that person that rescues those that rely on you begin to take advantage of you and they will suck you dry if you let them  In conclusion learning to set boundaries with those in your life that are too needy becomes a really important part of the process when you begin to recognize that you are unhappy and unfulfilled in life  It sounds like you may be at that crossroads right now  Take one small step at at a time  Identify the worst offenders in your life that suck time and energy and limit your contact andor set some strong boundaries with those people so you can refocus and do some soulsearching  Meanwhile engage in pleasurable activities with people you enjoy being with get yourself outside in the fresh air get some good sleep and eat some nourishing food
"wished for an accident, feel like I just shouldn't be here, wish I wouldn't have been born, chore, sign of something",Sounds like a sign of great unhappiness or sadness or insecurityThe real way youll find out what this feeling is about is to ask yourself your own question  Inside you are the only one who will feel when you discover the true answer to your questionEveryone feels some amount of discontent in their lives once in a while Its normal to not feel entirely happy all the timeTry to accept your unhappiness as motivation to learn more about who you are what you like whom you likeStudy yourself bc this way you increase the chance to find a road which feels right and happy
"smile, fake, happiness, show love, hate myself, loss of a loved one, not close to family",Trust and believe your own feelingsEmotions are real and reflect how someone feels about a situationSince youre sad about losing a loved one be patient w your feelings about this  Basically be guided by how you feel and eventually you will feel different emotions which I hope will be happier ones
"depressed, quit drinking, move, help, stay",Youre probably not going to like my answerYour question says a lot about what YOU want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her Sometimes whats best for a person is the hardest thing to do and may be completely opposite of what YOU wantAddictions dont happen in a vacuum If youve had any experience with addicts at all then Im sure youve heard the term enabler A lot of the times when people think theyre helping theyre actually enabling the addict to continue their selfdestructive behavior Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations but especially with addictions Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to usedrink continuing to do so or relapsing back into itYou said she recently quit You said she is depressed She wants to move When a person receives counseling for addictions they are encouraged to make changes like this They need to break the habit and this means removing people from their lives at times It means moving to new locations Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed Not only that but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they usedrink in the first place and not only break the physical addiction to it but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthyDont pressure her to stay Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do If she stays the decision needs to be hers and hers alone It doesnt need to be made under pressure That will only lead to resentment Support her but dont try to change her or make her do anything especially for selfish reasons Let her go It sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now It wouldnt be a bad idea for you to do the same
"teenager, dad in jail, tough, normal life, parent role, not stable, overdramatic, hurt, breaking down",Each person handles themselves differently in any situationSince you are willing to speak about how you feel keep looking for blogs and forums on whatever topics you feel most describe your current circumstanceYour mother and sister even though they are family seem to prefer the opposite method to yoursFind your own path of supportive other people and possibly a therapistThis way youll have understanding and validation which your mom and sister dont want to give you right now
"lost identity, unhappy, trapped, loathe myself, amazing life, enjoy",Good for you on being sensitive to your human need for personal evolutionWife and mother are meaningful positions  And in your case in order to feel your own growth other areas of who you are would like your attentionGive yourself time to allow your interest to wander in order to find the area of growth which will satisfy youJust like you know now that youd like more than your current situation trust yourself to know you will also know when youve arrived at another road youd like to take for your own happiness
"depression, anxiety, medication, worse, counseling",Thank you for asking this important question I find that there are three steps to getting ready for treatment Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change Congratulations you did the first step You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with  Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness and Solution Focused Brief Therapy Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression  The third step is to increase your positive selftalk to motivate yourself to attend treatment As counselors we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time However remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being I hope this was helpful and good luck with your treatment journey
"feel like I belong, good time, close, out with friends, never go home",From the little bit you wrote my guess is you havent figured out where and how to lay down your own set of rootsUsually people who have a university level eduction are old enough to work in order to support themselvesUnless you have a medical condition which limits or prevents you from working a fulltime job would you guess that the effort and thought involved in deciding in what professional area and geographic location to look for work would offer you a way to establish your identityMy suggestion is to pay more attention to your own likes dislikes and interests   To know these areas more deeply would define the type of people with whom you identify have a common interest and with whom youd like to socializeThe more you realize who you are the easier time youll have to find likeminded others and feel securely at home with them and yourselfAgain if you have a medical disability or condition which prevents employment or easily socializing with other people then this advice would need to be modified for your specific strengths
"worried, major depression, shut off, empty inside, anger, sadness, get help, refuses",First of all I can tell that you really care about your friend and I think its great that you are reaching out with your concern Its hard to determine whether your friend would meet the criteria for an official diagnosis of depression without working with him however whether he does or not therapy may be beneficial for him in working through these difficult feelings and relational challenges Unfortunately you cant make your friend get help He will ultimately need to make that decision for himself however you can talk to him about your concerns and your hopes that he will reach out for help
"jaded, cannot control my thoughts, cannot focus, anxiety attacks",Maybe your thoughts require your attention and the best course would be to pay attention and follow themIf youre in an especially stressful or uncertain time in your life then the best way through is to understand the tension you feelIt keeps trying to get you to know whats going on deep within youAnxiety is a sign of stress and weariness  Your thoughts are a chance to simply rest and know what they would like you to knowThen when that process is finished your anxiety will no longer be necessary and will most likely leave you alone
"sad, irritated, feeling, comes and goes, every day, making up symptoms, problems, actually wrong","Feelings are real is very unlikely that you are making them up since they are a response to the thoughts in your mind and your daily experiences and interactions Often we assume that feeling sadness is bad and that we should only feel happiness and joy but all feelings have a purpose joy sadness anger frustration excitement anxiety among others   Is not healthy to experience the same feeling for a long time so we should learn to identify what causes them and how to process them so you can navigate through life experiences with more ease I am a Licensed Professional Counselor in Texas currently providing services in West Houston  You may reach me at 7874665478 to schedule an appointment   Me he estado sintiendo tristeCuando salgo con una persona en particular o cuando llego a casa estoy triste o irritado  El sentimiento viene y va todo el día No sé qué está mal  No estoy seguro si estoy inventando los síntomas y problemas en mi cabeza o si algo realmente está mal Los sentimientos son muy reales y es muy poco probable que los estés inventando por que los sentimientos son una respuesta tanto a los pensamientos que hay en nuestra cabeza y a las situaciones que nos ocurren día a día  Muchas veces pensamos que sentirnos triste está mal y que solo debemos sentirnos alegres pero todas las emociones tienen un propósito y razón de ser tanto la alegría como la tristeza el coraje la frustración la excitación o el desespero entre otros  No es bueno quedarnos estancados una emoción  Así que es importante aprender a identificar que causa nuestros sentimientos como procesarlos para poder superar nuestras emociones y movernos de una experiencia a otra con más tranquilidad

"episodes of depression, panic attacks, can't control fears, can't care if live or die, freeze completely, talk to parents, talk about feelings","I understand that talking about our feelings can be awkward and using jokes is a way to relieve that awkwardness but there is a right or wrong way to talk about your feelings The important part is to recognize that you need help addressing those feelings and reaching out which you are doing already  Having small conversations with your family is helpful you can explain to them that you have been experiencing emotional discomfort and would like to talk to them about it   Since you been experiencing anxiety panic attacks and have thought about dying  It is VERY important that you ask them to help you make an appointment with a mental health professional  Those symptoms indicate that your body is having a hard time managing intense feelings and it will be helpful if you understand why they occur and how to cope with them You may contact your school counselor or you may schedule an appointment with a local therapist  You may contact the Texas Crisis Hotline 8009896884 where you can talk or chat with mental health professionals or schedule a teletherapy session   The National Crisis Hotline is also available for calling and texting 18002738255I am a Licensed Professional Counselor in Texas currently providing services in West Houston  You may reach me at 7874665478 to schedule an appointment   Cómo hablo de mis sentimientos de depresión y con quién habloSoy un adolecente  He estado experimentando episodios de depresión severa si es lo que creo por muchos años  Siempre se pone peor  He estado teniendo ataques de pánico sintiendo que no puedo controlar mis miedos y sintiendo que ya no importa si quiero vivir o morir  El problema es que ya no sé a quién pedirle ayuda  Cuando intento hablar con mis padres Me congelo y solo puedo hacer bromas porque nunca en mi vida hemos hablado de nuestros sentimientos Entiendo que hablar de tus emociones puede hacernos sentir inadecuados y bromear es una manera de manejar ese sentimiento incómodo pero no hay forma correcta o incorrecta de hablar sobre tus sentimientos  Lo importante es reconocer que necesitas ayuda para manejarlos y ya tu estas en ese proceso  Tener pequeñas conversaciones con tu familia te ayudara a explicarles los sentimientos que estas experimentando  Es importante que les pidas hacer una cita con un profesional de la salud mental ya que has estado experimentando síntomas que indican que tu cuerpo ya no puede manejar tus sentimientos y necesita nuevas herramientas  Puedes contactar a tu consejero escolar o a un proveedor de salud mental cerca de ti o por teléfono  Mientras tanto puedes llamar a la línea de crisis de Texas 8009896884 para hablar con un profesional de salud mental  La línea nacional de crisis también esta disponible en todos los Estados Unidos y proveen servicios en español 18002738255

"lazy, numb, no interest",Maybe right now it is time for you to rest before the next wave of new activity comes alongTo have no interest may mean you are already so saturated with recent situations and their meaning that you are naturally withdrawing in order to regain your energy
"struggling with, diagnosed depression, anxiety, Misophonia, Borderline Personality Disorder, Avoidant Personality Disorder, self-diagnosing, right research",Any diagnosis is limited in its usefulnessKnowing the name of some typical ways you may feel think and behave doesnt help you or anyone to understand why the person is the way they are and how to change any of these characteristicsBoth selfdiagnosing and being diagnosed are equally unhelpful to know why you are the way you are and what to do about itConsider yourself a person who wants to find a better way to be who you are and this will get you further with better results than to read a list of descriptions which all are very indicting and negative sounding
"lonely, alone, depression, make new friends, need help",Definitely it is sad to lose friends who are a regular part of daily lifeHow did you meet the two friends who just moved away   Its possible that you could look for similar situations and see if anyone catches your interest to know as a friendKeeping in mind that friendship is based on trust and common interests and that these qualities require time to observe and develop think of what you can do to keep happy while these paths unfoldIn addition to being open to meeting new friends involve yourself in projects from which youll feel satisfied by your own results
"problem, argue, worthless, crying, sleep, family, cant stand",I am so very sorry for how pressured and sad you feel right nowDefinitely all family members have an effect on the other onesFrom what you write your family members are not considering the effect their negative comments have on youAlso keep in mind that each person is responsible for deciding to argue or find a different way to discuss a problem You are not in control of the other people in your familyMore likely they take the easy way out and blame you for what they dont want to know about themselvesStay aware that the familys decision to target you doesnt mean that you are doing something wrong   Certainly your existence is not wrong which is the degree to which the unfairness seems to have spreadWhat to do about it is read about family systems to see more explanations on how you are being unfairly treatedAlso stay in touch with friends bc these are the people who value and respect you
"depressed, anxiety, picking at skin, causing fights, million miles a minute",One way to know yourself a little better and why the dynamics you describe take place is to understand the particular dynamics of your life contextLook at your major areas of where you spend your time whether you are happy with the people with whom you socialize how you feel toward family members and how they seem to feel toward youIf you examine your relationships and life this way then you may start to notice areas where you have some control or at least a say in how your life is goingIf you are socializing among people whom you dont like have a job you dont like and your family mistreats you and you mistreats them for example then anxiety and depression are an understandable natural resultIf you make improvements in your life and relationships even tiny improvements and even the effort and intention to improve you may find your anxiety and depression dissipatingPeople usually feel their worst when they feel lack of control in their lifeLook for ways you can regain andor strengthen yours
"depressed, find someone to talk to",You have already taken the brave first step of making the decision to heal from it and find a professional that will help you do so There are lots of different options nowadays for therapists as you can see them online or in an office  My biggest tip for you is to use Psychology Today or Counsel Chat to find a therapist  Enter in your zip code and you will find many different therapists you can talk to  Be sure to find someone that you most resonate with and ask them any questions you may have Many  times therapists will provide free consultations and this can be a great opportunity to see if you are a good fit
"bad mood, no energy, depression",Depression has many different signs and symptoms and looks different for every person  Often times people think depression is more about feeling sad but depression can in fact express itself through irritability or bad mood as you say and lack of energy  According to the DSMV Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders depression includes the following symptomsDepressed moodIrritable moodDecreased interest or pleasure in activities you usually participate in or enjoySignificant weight change or change in appetiteChange in sleep insomnia or hypersomniaPsychomotor aggitation or retardationFatigue or loss in energy Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guiltDiminished ability to concentrate or indecisivenessThoughts of suicide or plan The great news is that there are many ways to improve depressive symptoms  If you are up for it perhaps the best place to start is by seeing a physician or a therapist who can help determine how severe the depression is and can suggest methods of addressing the depression that fit your lifestyle values and capabilities  Good luck
"late teens, live with dad, college classes, see friends, want to talk, not want to talk, feel not worth knowing, never going to do anything right, depressed","I wouldnt necessarily say you are clinically depressed based on
that first paragraph in your question Because that could describe more
introverted behavior people who feel more energy from a more internal approach
as opposed to those who feel more energy from being among others It is more
in the second paragraph that I would be inclined to say that further
exploration is definitely needed The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder is
more than just those two symptoms but there are more mild forms of depression
that can be equally damaging to someone if left untreatedHowever one of the trickiest parts of this is that someone who
feels they are not worth knowing may also believe they are not worth having a
therapist know them and even less worthy of being helped Do you feel that
might be you If so could we acknowledge that as a part of the big picture
and all wrapped up in these feelings about yourself and realizing that
thoughts and feelings arent always rational in that you are worth getting the
helpMy recommendation just from the information would be that you seek
out a supportive listening ear in the form of a therapist who can allow you
the space to express some of these difficult experiences and help you name FOR
YOURSELF what your struggle is To empower you to name it for yourself as
opposed to everyone labeling andor judging you for it might be an extremely
worthwhile start for you"
"trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, extremely hungry, not hungry, angry, crying, down, depression, help",Sounds like signs of someone who is depressedSince the person in question is your friend offer your friendship to listen to any situations or feelings she has about herself and the way her life is goingDepressed people are often lonely people and feel as though no one around them cares or notices them  Your willingness to be available to her may lift her spirits  Feeling loved goes a long way to dissolving depressed feelingsAlso if in the beginning when you offer to talk there is a high chance shell be defensive and turn down your offerTry again on another day and then another dayWhen people feel depressed they usually shut down  So you may need a few or several tries before your friend accepts your offer to show her you care about how she is doingAlso watch for signs within yourself that your friends depression is not sinking your emotions  Depressed people are draining to be around because they often see and talk about only the negatives and drawbacks of situations
"moodiness, extreme feelings, empty, emotionless, trust issues, low self esteem, fear of abandonment, reevaluate relationships, not happy, happy",Sometimes the way to feel happy is to address all the questions you just describedTeenage years are the first time any of us starts to feel and recognize our uniqueness  The fact that you recognize your great range of feelings as uncomfortable as they may sometimes be is healthyAlso healthy is that you are asking for opinions of therapists who would be familiar with when a range of feelings shows an out of the ordinary problemOne path to take is to reflect on the topics you wrote here and especially to ask yourself your reasons for how the problem started and what it would take for it to resolveDo you have trust issues because someone broke your trust Youre entitled to a repair of your trust by the other person   Even if the person never offers this to you to know you deserve to be restored to whole may help you feel more secureThe same is true with the other topics abandonment and relationships generallyThe more you continue to value your unique understanding expectations and standards the more likely youll create relationships which do not have these qualities and you will restore your sense of hope that other people may treat you in a fair and kind way
"troubled upbringing, dealing with a lot, overwhelmed, depression, therapy, counseling",What matters most is how you feel and what youre doing with whom youre interacting whether you feel youve got enough interaction to be happyWhether or not a clinician would decide to identify you as depressed matters much less than how you actually are feeling if you have some ideas as to what might improve your sense of being and how to go about reaching your goalsIf therapy during your childhood made you feel better and you feel you may be depressed then trying therapy at this point in your life makes senseThe worst that can happen is you find you feel better than you first understoodThe best that can happen is you find a caring therapist who helps you find faith in yourself again
"depressed, sleep in, eat, smoke weed, watch movies, go on phone, unmotivated, angry, negative, distracted, help",How do you help yourself to believe you require more than what he offers to youWhat do you get from this relationship which feels satisfyingTo answer this question may in the longterm be the best way to help your bf
"depression, combative, unsupportive, uncomfortable, instigate conversations, arguments, understand",Your situation sounds extremely frustratingYoure doing the right move to state you dont want to discuss your depression with herI guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression  If you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation and you would like to tell her your true reason then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time not in the middle of an argumentHaving an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept  You may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this
"sad, family issues, feeling controlled, feeling restricted, not liking family members",HelloWhile one can be sad from time to time feeling sad all the time could be a sign of depression If you feel sad on most days it is worthwhile speaking to a psychologist to determine whether you suffer clinical depression Feeling sadness is a normal response to loss whether you lose a family friend job or something you deem important in your life However feeling sadness all the time is a signal that you are not happy about something in your life If it is related to your family and often relationship with family members could affect our selfesteem and selfworth then perhaps it is worthwhile exploring what you find unhappy about your relationship with your family Is it that you do not feel heard supported or loved Is it that you feel disrespected disregarded or feel unimportant These are just a few examples of common issues that people report that contribute to their depression To help you to uncover your reasons for your sadness or depression and to cope with them in a healthier and more constructive way it may be helpful to contact a therapist who could support you with this process You do not have to deal with it alone Dr Virginia Chow Montreal Psychologist For more information about depression please consult my website at wwwPsychologyResourceca
"anxiety, feel any emotion, not even for myself",Thank you for posting  Im interested to hear some more information such as if you live by yourself or family if you go to schoolemployedunemployed and what kind of things do you like to do with friends or by yourself  Often times when we are experiencing a strong emotion that we interpret as negative we put most of our focus on that negative emotion and struggle to see that we do not always feel that specific emotion  There are typically points in the day even if it is for only in 1 minute intervals when we do not feel that negative emotion  When we overgeneralize we use words like always or never and when we use those words and it may not be totally true we feel the negative emotion based on an inaccuracy which is not fair to you  Ask yourself some of these questions Am I being realistic when Im overgeneralizing things Have I ever noticed a short period of time that I wasnt feeling anxious  What do I notice when I am feeling anxious What am I thinking about  When was the last time I felt empathy  What was different when I was able to feel empathy  Hopefully this helps get you started
"depression, deal with, dont know, dont want, tell anyone, deal with depression, without telling anyone",Love yourself more and treat yourself kindly with empathy and compassionUsually when people feel depressed they also feel lonely and isolated  Since at this time you wouldnt want to tell anyone about the way you feel which includes the possibility that a few of the ones whom you tell would offer you emotional support give this to yourselfAlso consider to make a goal of eventually telling someone whom you are reasonably sure would understand and empathize about your depressionThis will help alleviate the sense of shame unworthiness and pervasive guilt which often comes along with depressionSending you good luck
"illness, never go away, life will never change, feel alone, no one, overcome pain, learn to be happy, alone",Is it possible that even though your illness is chronic that it goes through phases in which you are more comfortable and that it requires less focus from you than at other timesI think the idea of having a lifelong illness is frustrating and can be depressing to think about  Thoughts are not necessarily the truth of what will actually happen thoughIllness makes negative situations look worse so be sure you are concentrating on specific areas of your life and not just assuming they will work out badly because you are illOne way to be happy alone is to love and appreciate nurture and be kind to yourselfThis frame of mind may generate new answers to find ways of being among other people too
"happy, sad, gone, unable, independent",Hello So someone made you happy but is no longer around I am sure that feels devastating As a counselor I usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external rather than the internal side of a persons life Happiness is formed within ourselves All the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting and temporary Even relationships fo not last forever If we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves We are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy Sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace or resolution to a specific problemWhat I would offer to you is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself What do you like about your life as it is right now What can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness These kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event Mourning the loss of a social connection in whatever way that occurred is part of the grieving process but it is not permanent It is a path to healing and moving forward From this you can seek out new sources of happiness I encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world Happiness is an expression of the internal feelings so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw If you are lacking in happiness then it becomes important to examine why that is and what you can do about it to promote selfcare Seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the griefloss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supplyI wish you happiness for every day of your lifeBest wishes
"internally screaming, intense emotion, emotionally distant, caged animal",It is hard to make a definite diagnosis however I would say  that it could be and or a combination of depression stress PTSD etc  More background information would have to be needed  One thing I would say is that you really need to seek guidance from a professional to work through these symptoms  If what you described as a caged animal is released all the crying sadness and controllable emotions will come out  That would not be good when they do  Get help before they do
"emotions, symptoms, situations, talk with parents, love, personalities, not taken seriously, serious event, pansexual, trust issues, fought depression, stress, anxiety, friends not listening, own problems, childhood taken, lack of trust.",First of all I am sorry that you have been missing out on your childhood It may help you to know that many of us feel that we have missed out on our childhoods as well and that despite such deprivations for many of us our adult lives have been extraordinarily fulfilling due to our opening up to trusted adults I recommend that you find a trustworthy adult to talk to This may be a teacher a coach a school counselor a minister a family member or a friends family member If none of these are available try out a professional counselor social worker psychiatric nurse practitioner psychologist or a psychiatrist It is best to get a referral for such a professional from a peer who has had a positive and safe experience with a particular provider
"empty, feel nothing, stop feeling",A feeling of emptiness can be from a lack of awareness and acknowledgment for the things the people the places that you have in your life The use of affirmation and gratitudes helps to remind ourselves of all of the aspects of our lives
"hurt, not good enough, past garbage, went wrong, expected to be over, pain, apologies, dont know, anymore",It sounds like you have been thinking about how past hurts have influenced you and when you try to talk about these hurts with people in your life you are feeling invalidated It also sounds like current conflicts are continuing to leave you feeling hurt and devalued In working with a therapist you may be able to get some clarity about your past who you are and what kinds of boundaries you want in your relationships so that you can lead a life that is more satisfying to you
"hard time, depressed, parents getting a divorce, bad things happening, lull myself",It sounds like a tough time and its normal to feel down when your family is going through a divorce or other hardship Theres a difference between feelings like sadness discouragement grief loneliness and depression though Sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process that is a normal reaction to events in our lives Depression on the other hand is more about being stuck Lulling yourself with selfcare sounds like a healthy response and a way to give yourself support So as to the uncomfortable but healthy part of your feelings do the best you can to put names to it and share with a trusted other person You will find comfort The part of your situation thats depression  feeling stuck not able to get out of bad concentrate changes in sleeping and eating loss of enjoyment in living poor hygiene feelings of hopelessness thats different First step identify your own symptoms of depression If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself tell someone If youre not sure you can try 800lifenet or other support line to get feedback First aid for depression includes daily care and feeding good sleeping and eating lots of exerciseeven when you dont feel like it healthy socializing and focusing on talking to yourself in a positive way If you arent able to move yourself out of your depression  work with a professional to make shortterm goals and get some support You may also talk to your doctor or psychiatrist about trying an antidepressant to give you a little lift while you go through a rough patchBest wishesKaren
"depression, reoccurring, bullied, crying spells, stress, confronting classmates, tough program, high demands, self-harming, regret, handling problems, hopeless, overreacting, coping with stress, sad, loved ones",I couldnt help but notice that you did not specify your age so I am unable to set the total chronological order and length that you have suffered in this way but I want to start by commending you on seeking out additional coping techniques on your own  Unfortunately it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm From what you have written stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage  Often when I am working with those who offer the same concern there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress  When we are trying to make others happy especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper rules for success it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming Stress management is just that management of our own anxieties about the needs of others about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time Each of these aspects requires a separate sets of tools to manage them accordingly For example assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties Try to separate the different areas of the problem in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time Perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your lesshelpful responses to stress For example does a certain persons style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first Is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity  Is that the time fo the day where you also tend to pile up your requirementsTry to ask yourself some of these harder questions and see where they lead you
"depressed, trying to work through, rock, trust, break up, cannot afford, therapist, insurance, deductible, suicidal thoughts, quit job, family, kicked out, friends, moved on, ex-boyfriend, break down into tears, never be promoted, emotions, symptoms, situations",It sounds like you have been struggling with this for quite some time using many of the same coping techniques that feel tried and true to no avail Often we fall back on coping techniques that would be helpful in other problems stress social anxieties etc for our depression but the truth is that depression requires its own little tool kit Depression is allencompassing and based on what youve written the symptoms are already affecting work and your personal life in myriad ways  The best route forward would be to seek out counselling admittedly but if your insurance deductible is too high that can be very expensive I would recommend contacting your Employee Assistance Program EAP if offered by your employer If not you can look into community centres for counselling options check if your doctor will give you a referral or your local religious organization If however you are motivated to get your depression under control there are some great workbooks out there that you can use on your own or with your therapist as long as your therapist is trained in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy or CBT such as Mind Over Mood
"angry, wonderful, depressed, hopeless",Hello and thank you for your question This is a very serious time I dont mean to frighten you but you are right to be concerned The time right after people leave the hospital after receiving psychiatric services is a time of high risk for suicide It is very important after hospitalization to get followup care with a professional as soon as possible If your husband has an established therapist this is the time to call It is also a good time to alert your support system of friends family clergy or others to let them know he is still struggling This is good support for him AND youIt is important to think about means and opportunity to make another attempt Means really do matter  So if you have a firearm in the home it is really important to remove it You cant remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with but some things are more lethal than others Firearms are very lethal I am not sure what means he used last time but try to reduce the opportunity for him to access it again This is where your support system can help out People can take turns hanging out with him until you are sure the crisis is overIf you believe that an attempt is going to occur talk to your husband about going back to the hospital If he refuses you will want to find out what your options are to have him go even if he doesnt want to I know the thought of that really hurts but it can save his life Calling 911 is always a good option if you are not sure Usually a suicide crisis meaning they want to harm themselves right now lasts a few minutes hours or days Sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage they no longer want to commit suicide But as you are indicating that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again So it is always good to have a plan If you want more information call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline They will always answer 18002738255 They can help you create a specific safety plan I do hope things work out alright Be well Robin J Landwehr DBH LPCC NCC
"feel like doing something wrong, crappy, want to cry, cant eat, cant sleep",You are describing some of the most common symptoms of depression low self esteem difficulty sleeping changes in appetite sad mood feelings of hopeless and feelings of worthlessness A full assessmentevaluation with a mental health professional is warranted to understand if indeed you meet criteria for a Major Depressive Disorder ie are delressed One thing I often tell patients is that Do you think you are depressed People often answer yes or no but many individuals respond with a question How would I know To that I often explain that if I stopped watching movies or better stopped enjoying watching movies that would be a clear indication for me that I am delressed It would be a sign that I have lost pleasure or interest in the activity that I typically enjoy most  Ill ask you to think of one activity which you really really enjoy  It could be anything from reading to being with friends to skiing to watching tv  I would like to now ask you if you have stopped enjoying that activity or cant find the motivation to engage in it This is another symptom of depression loss in pleasurable activities The good news is that there are many effective available treatment if you are indeed in a depression or simply you want to modifydecrease your depressive symptoms ie you want to stop feeling so tired and so worthless Treatment includes one or more of the following psychotherapy medication exercise Any one or combination of both of these can help to improve your mood The even better news is that feeling that you are doing something wrong can diminish with appropriate treatment over time  I hope you find this information helpful The most important next step is to get evaluated by a mental health professional typically a psychologist or psychiatrist and for both you and the professional to better understand your symptoms and your mood in the context of what is going on in your life
"emotions decreasing, fights with fiancée, carry expressions, symptoms",Sometimes repressing anger can lead to depression and block all kinds of other emotions too  I would wonder about your experience with anger and if youve ever been discouraged from expressing anger  I would also wonder if you feel like you have space to express yourself in your relationship or if you feel like you really arent being heard  Its hard to feel cared for and connected to someone else when you dont feel accepted by them
"depressed, scared, reactions, argument, young, ungrateful, exhausted, pretending, tired, help needed, future",Hi Georgia Theres a really good lesson here People tell us things and we tend to think thats the truthbut its not Ill do some translating for youYoure so ungrateful means I need you to be successful and happy in order for me to feel Im a good parentYoure too young to be depressed means I dont want to deal with your mental health issues right now Ill pretend its not happening so I dont have to face my fear and shameIts only going to get worse just means I dont know how to support you beyond scaring you into wanting to at least fake happiness for my sakeYour parents are being unsupportive not because youre not suffering but because this is all theyre capable of right now They are not where you will find the support you need so keep looking for it in other places Its out there If might be an aunt or a friend or a friends aunt It might be a therapist or a bus driver or your family doctor Keep looking for someone who will hear you I hope you dont ever give up
"terrible anxiety, depression, various therapists, pills, nothings helped",Is it possible you simply didnt mix well with the particular therapists with whom youve worked   If this is possible interview a therapist before  starting therapy   Then you will be choosing a therapist who feels compatible with your way of seeing yourself and your lifeAlso therapy isnt for everyoneRead about the different healing modalities and see if one of these speaks to your interest in feeling betterWhat matters most is finding among all the legitimate healing methods what you believe will be effective
"emotions, symptoms, situations, better life, goals, plans, electrician, heavy machinery, kids, fiancée, early 20s, worked, turned 18, do nothing, feel, meet.",For starters commend yourself for being committed to working You have no idea what is going to happen in the next second so focusing on thinking you will never have a good career or amount to anything financially is creating a fictitious story  Remind yourself of that every time the thought pops up  The false belief that nothing good will happen is sucking out energy you can use on pursuing your career dreams Next do you know what you need to do to become an electrician or heavy machinery operator If not find out Then set up a realistic schedule for yourself to accomplish the steps As you accomplish each step see your progress  Notice that you are moving closer to your goal  Every day remind yourself why you are pursuing this career  In fact write it down and tape it on your bathroom mirror  When you start to feel discouraged remember your goal and remind yourself that you have no idea if youll make it or not but you are going to give it everything you have to find out Anything worth pursuing is going to take a lot of persistence and hard work Stay with it You and your family are worth it
"worse, crying, worried, constantly changing his mind, handle what I'm going through, respect the decision, leave, work it out",Wow that is tough There is nothing worse than fearing abandonment when you are already struggling with depression It sounds like you are still wanting to work through whatever challenges you and your husband are having but your husband may not be on the same page I would encourage you and your husband to seek professional support if you havent already While depression can put real strains on a relationship relationship problems can lead to or contribute to depression and there may be some real benefits to both of you in doing some couple therapy With that being said  if your husband is not willing to do therapy or is clear that he wants the relationship to end then I cant see what choice you have but to respect his decision as you mentioned This doesnt mean that you have to feel okay with the decision  as Im sure you wouldnt  but ultimately loving one another and staying in committed relationships is a choice that we each have to make If he is wanting to leave  this could make things a lot tougher for you I would encourage you to seek professional support for yourself and reach out to lots of friends and family You do not need to face depression alone  nor should you have to We all need support at tough times like these
"late 50s, never loved, never been loved, deeper help, small town, agoraphobia, losing hope, brain barely works, memory loss, serve no purpose, incapable of work, complete waste of time, keep trying, God insists, tired",The fact that youre reaching out says that there is something in you that wants this to be different and that drive might be something worth tapping into Why do I keep trying is a question that might give you some insight into what it is in you that keeps you going A lot of therapistscounselors are now offering video therapy As long as youre in the same state as a therapist offering this service you could connect with someone helpful from the comfort of your home even being in your small town Id recommend looking into this option because youre asking a lot of really deep questions and might benefit from having those conversations with someone who can help you find your own answers
"overwhelming depression, extreme effect, uncomfortable about sex, found them, suffer, suicide, parents, husbands sex lives, understand, feel",Hello and thank you for your question First I want to tell you how sorry I am for the experience you had with your parents That is a grief and trauma that is certainly hard to imagine Trauma and grief can affect us in many ways and certainly deeply personal things like our sex lives It may be difficult for others to make the connection but it is there So for example if stress and trauma make you feel like you are not interested in sex a partner may take it as a personal rejection rather than response to stress trauma or grief If your husband will agree to it couples counseling may be your best bet A counselor can help you with your communication and may be able to provide some education to your husband about trauma and how it can have an impact on intimacy If he doesnt agree to go it may be worth it to go on your own You still have a lot you are dealing with yourself And sometimes our personally therapy can influence others so it may be a good idea It is important to remember that even though you are married you have the right to make decisions about your body and that includes when you want to have sex with it I hope this is helpful and some of my colleagues may have ideas also Be wellRobin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC
"bipolar disorder, paranoid personality disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, self-harmed, stressed, overwhelmed, hurt, angry, urge to self-harm, seek help",Seeking professional help does not mean that you will necessarily be admitted into an inpatient setting  though  to be honest that can become an option if you feel unsafe or if you are unable to plan for safety However many clients who struggle with selfharm can find help in outpatient settings  particularly those which offer a treatment called Dialectical Behavioral Therapy DBT Looking for a DBT professional or group therapy setting may be particularly helpful but a skilled professional can help you to figure out how to identify other options even when you are experiencing overwhelming emotions Without knowing your location I also recommend searching to find your local helpline or suicide prevention hotline The volunteers on the other end of the line can be very helpful even if your intention is not suicide and they are likely also to be able to connect you with resources in your area Calling into the helpline may also be a first step alternative to selfharming when youre feeling overwhelmed
"stress over everything, quality time, resentment, great kids, break down easily, depressed",Everyone has some level of anxiety  its what helps us respond to stressors in our lives and clues us into the fact that we need to respond to something going on However if youre feeling overwhelmed by racing thoughts feeling like you spend a lot of energy worrying about something specific or even pretty much anything at all and youre starting to find that its getting in your way when it comes to living your life the way you want then Id suggest seeing a counselor or therapist for an assessment for anxiety Your other concerns though seem pretty normal for someone who is in a relationship with a partner who has children As a married stepmother Ive been there and as a therapist I can tell you that the boundaries and communication skills you have in your relationships need to be healthy for you to feel healthy Finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful  being able to hear from others that you arent alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations Another option is to find a counselor or therapist who has experience working with stepblended family dynamics  because even if youre not officially married those dynamics come into play whenever there are kids from another relationship involved You may even consider couples counseling so that both of you can learn to talk about your relationship needs and concerns in a way that will encourage connection and strengthen your sense of partnership
"deep depression, can't function, peace when asleep, can't think straight, not feeling like myself",I dont know how long ago your breakup was but I would suggest that you reach out to friends or family that you trust and perhaps a local mental health clinicianIm not sure what you mean when you say that you are not able to function during the day and night If you are having trouble sleeping for more than a few nights consider talking with your primary care physician Not sleeping can really make changes in your emotions seem much largerCan you find anything in your life that is the same as it was before the breakup This may be a starting point for you I wonder if you could think of and moment or two each day when you feel emotionally at peace while you are awake Also consider looking at things that you can control such as when you choose to wear eat and who you talk to about your deepest feelingsYou mentioned that you have friends and family I wonder if any of them are supportive to youPlease reach out and talk to someone about the details I get the sense that you feel that you are alone in this and having someone there to help you sort out what youre feeling sounds like it would be a gift to yourself
"depression, anxiety, voices in my head, problems sleeping, attention deficit disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, self-harmed, suicidal, therapy",If you have already been diagnosed with attentiondeficit disorder and obsessivecompulsive disorder can you go back to the people who diagnosed you with those thingsIt may be that your parents would be open to you talking with someone because it sounds like you have done this in the past I dont know whether you have a specific reason that you are thinking they may have some hesitation but if you are comfortable saying that you would really like to talk to someone because you are feeling sad or anxious or whichever of your concerns you feel comfortable revealing to them that may be a way to start the process As for how you tell them about the fact that you have harmed yourself in the past and used to be suicidal a therapist may be able to work together with you to discuss the best way to tell them about thatIm not sure if you have told anyone about what you have been experiencing but if you have some support there perhaps they would be able to give you feedback about ways to talk with your parents as wellYou mentioned that sometimes you hear voices This can happen for a variety of reasons but if the voices that you hear are giving you directions and you feel as though you might follow them that would be a time to ask for immediate help before you follow through with what they are telling you perhaps by calling 8002738255 They may be able to connect you with local resources and they can definitely talk with you in the moment that you call
"depressed, break up, wants me for sex, ugly, want to die, big when pregnant, stretch marks",If you are currently feeling as if you want to die please call 8002738255 and talk to someoneOne way to work on not always thinking so negatively about yourself is to surround yourself with people who are more positive toward you Do you have friends or family who are supportiveCan you find one part of you that you do not think is uglyIf your stretch marks are still bothering you talk with a pharmacist or your primary care physician Sometimes there are creams or lotions you can use to decrease stretch marks and they should be able to guide you in the right directionYou mentioned mostly physical things here I wonder if you can find one small thing each day that is going right and build from there Perhaps your son makes you smile
"sad, confused, angry, tired, don't sleep well",Being tired can really affect almost everyones ability to work through things that make them sad confused or angry among other emotions If youre having difficulty sleeping try to get into a habit of going to bed and waking up close to the same time every day Also consider only using the bed for sleeping so your brain knows that its time to sleep when you are in bed If you are not sleeping while you are in bed consider getting up and reading a book or doing something to make you tired before going back to bed Hopefully youll be able to establish a patternSometimes sadness and other emotions make sleeping very difficult as well Try keeping track of your moods to see what is leading up to the changesIf youre still struggling consider talking with a therapist about the specifics andor maybe talking with your primary care physician There are natural sleep remedies that he or she may recommend for you
"lost everything, jobs, cars, freedom, money, stay-at-home mom, no money, no car, never goes out, cleans all day",There are an infinite number of possibilities here You included a lot of things that you dont have Is there anyway that you can have some freedom for a few hours a week at least A lot of times stay at home moms have groups when they meet at different public places where their children can play together and they can talk together I dont know how old your child or children isare but perhaps going back to work is something that can happen in the futureI wonder if you may consider who you have in your life who can support you I dont know whether you have a spouse or parents or siblings who could help out with some different things I wonder if you could consider where you would like to go if you had two or three hours that you could do whatever you wanted If you can sort out some possible answers to that maybe you can work together with friends or family to make it happenAlso again depending on the age of your children some parents can do things while the children are sleeping even if you are in the same room For example if your children are sleeping for about two hours maybe 30 minutes of that could be reserved for you and the rest could be for cleaning or other things you need to do
"depression, stress, anxiety, lack of time, self-care",Im not sure whether you are referring to having a lot of activities after school or that homework is overwhelming Can you set aside a couple hours a week for yourself as a place to start
"emotional destroyed, hate myself, embarrassing, medical issues, armed forces, dream, worried, family, separated, alone, contract, military",It sounds like being separated from the armed forces is a major loss for you It takes some time to work through the emotions related to this and it often takes longer if you are trying to work through it without a lot of supportIs there a task that you were doing during your military service that can in some way transfer into civilian life I dont know what else your life involves whether you have close friends or a romantic partner a career activities that you like to do and many other things You may be able to use some of the things that you still have today as a way to start moving forward in a different directionYour military service will always be a part of you Thank you for your service
"depressed, happy facade, sad, killing myself, family deserve better, cry, write in my book, feelings",It sounds like you have several different things happening at the same time I would encourage you to call and speak to a local therapist If you are having thoughts of killing yourself in this moment please call 8002738255 and talk to someoneWhile I follow that you would like your son to be unaware of what you are going through that doesnt mean that you cant discuss your feelings with someone else Who is it that you trust or could speak with about this A therapist could be one person but perhaps there is someone else in your life as wellOne thing that may help is to find a bead or rock that is smooth and you can hold onto it while thinking of a specific memory where you were happy This could be from as long ago as necessary as long as it is specific and you can place yourself back in that time when you are thinking about it If you think about this time while holding onto the bead the bead may remind you of a time when you felt happy You could do the same thing for a time when you felt comfortable and safeHave you recognized any patterns for what is leading you to be sadCan you think of anything that makes you feel good even if it only works for a few minutes
"depression, affecting my life, affecting my sleep, parents insurance, see a therapist, dont believe in it",The answer here really depends upon your age and something called the age of consent in the state where you live In Pennsylvania anyone over the age of 14 can provide consent for their own treatment As for billing purposes try talking to some local agencies If you are under 18 you may be able to have Medicaid out of medical necessity so that you can have treatment If you are over 18 there may be some discounted rates at some agencies because of the situation youre in Maybe your primary care physician will be able to refer you to some local agenciesIf you are in school you may be able to talk with a guidance counselor or someone at the school This would not require using your insurance
"sad, alone, cut myself",Try doing something physical If you havent exercised before it is a good idea to get your doctors approval first but this can be helpfulThe more you can find out about when you want to cut the easier it will be to figure out what else you can do If you are feeling sad or angry or nervous look at what is leading up to those feelings and talk to someone about thatYou said you are alone I would see if you can find someone that you can trust to talk with about what you are going through This could be a parent a friend someone at school a coworker or any number of other people
"addiction, try to stop, want to do, draw, doesn't work",Ive heard people say that they cut themselves as a way to feel relief from different emotions Youre also right that when you try to focus on just not cutting it becomes more difficult because its what you are focused on While that is still something to work on it may also be helpful to find something else you can do instead You said drawing doesnt work for you Sometimes more physical activities such as doing a few jumping jacks can be helpful If you dont exercise it might be something to talk with your doctor about firstThe more you can learn about what makes you want to cut the easier it will be to find out what you could do to change that Try talking to somebody about what you are feeling in addition to the urge to cut

"lot on my mind, stay locked in my room, not socialize, feel so alone",It has been said that depression is often the result of a blocked goal  Often people struggle with both anxiety and depression but have difficulty determining which is the most important issue For some depression is the result of frequently blocked goals and when their predominant issues are evaluated they discover that they are anxious worried about a lot of areas in their life but seem to find no relief  When there is no relief and there have been numerous attempts either in their mind or in practical application to resolve the anxiety depression is often the result  In this type of case depression is not the main or underlying issue The anxiety is the underlying issue  Having a lot on my mind sounds like anxiety Unresolved anxiety can lead to feelings of depression which are often associated with emptiness  In the question above I would want to evaluate all of the issues surrounding having a lot on my mind and determine where these might be coming from Has there been ongoing rejection from peers From family If so why does this seem to be happening  Isolation is often a protective measure that one implements to avoid further pain Where does that need to protect originate  Are there unmet needs from childhood Are there traumatic life events that have created a need to selfprotect as a defense mechanism We can feel alone even when in a crow of people or at a party  This has nothing in this case to do with being around people It has more to do with how we view ourselves  If there is a prevailing message or script that has been internalized that says You are worth nothing or You dont deserve the company of others then being around people will not alleviate the problem but only exacerbate it I would want to evaluate how one feels about themselves and what negative messages one has received and has repeated to oneself over time The Developmental Needs Meeting Strategy is a therapy aimed at addressing unmet childhood needs If there is specific trauma that is associated with socializing with people then EMDR can be very helpful in desensitizing and reprocessing the trauma  Looking at whether this individuals issue with emptiness is straight depression or whether it is depression as a result of unresolved anxiety is key to determining a treatment strategy

"posttraumatic stress disorder, overcome, vivid, scared, paranoid, depression, struggling, young age","I understand that at times its difficult to share with our parents what we have been trough due to fear of judgment or punishment but I have noticed that keeping our experiences secret intensifies them  And Post Traumatic Stress Disorder can haunt us for a long time if we do not learn to process the memories that cause those symptoms  If you have been victim of a traumatic event that you are not prepared to share with your parents its important that you seek help with a counselor therapist or psychologist  Trauma Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a great technique to cope with physical symptoms you could also use Narrative therapy Creative Therapy or Journaling as a way to express memories and process them with your therapist  A psychiatrist can also prescribe medication to manage the symptoms but is very important that you address the trauma so you can heal and go back to live your life   Many organizations like the United Way 211 in many states offer resources and referrals to put you in touch with mental health providers you could also talk to your school counselor doctor or church to find referral that could help Tip You dont have to tell you story to each person you ask for help you can just start by asking for a counselor referral Cómo puedo superar el Desorden de Estrés Post Traumático sin que mis padres se enterenComprendo que muchas veces puede ser difícil compartir nuestras experiencias con nuestros padres muchas veces por miedo a que nos juzguen o castiguen pero he observado cómo mantener un secreto lo vuelve más fuerte y difícil de manejar   El Desorden de Estrés Post Traumático puede ser una condición que nos persigue por mucho tiempo si no aprendemos a procesar las memorias que causan esos síntomas  Si has sido víctima de un trauma que tal vez no estás listoa para compartir con tus padres es importante que busques la ayuda de algún consejero profesional terapista o sicólogo  La Terapia Cognitiva Conductual enfocada en el Trauma es una técnica que te ayudara a manejar muchos de los síntomas también puedes utilizar diarios o Terapia Narrativa o creativa para expresar memorias y procesarlas luego en terapia  Un Psiquiatra también te puede proveer medicamentos que ayudan a manejar los síntomas del Estrés Post Traumático pero es importante que atiendas el problema inicial para poder sanar por completo y volver a tomar las riendas de tu vida   Muchas organizaciones como los Fondos Unidos 211 en muchos estados tiene recursos que proveen referidos a consejeros o profesionales de la salud mental  También puedes preguntarle a tu consejero escolar doctor o en la iglesia

"single mother, molested, lost myself, focus on children, relationships fail, children's father left, depressed",What your are experience is normal for most women  We usually forget about self and totally focus on our children putting our personal wants and needs aside  So to answer your question of how do you get to know yourself I usually do a 6 session course with my client by having them answer questions such as the following in the first session  What do I love other than your children  What are my own needs and desires  What 3 things have I accomplished in my life that Im most proud of  What are 5 strengths or qualities I have  What is one event that had a major impact on my life  How have that event affected my life today   For their homework assignment after the 1st session they are asked to write a letter to self tell self what they love cherish appreciate and even admire about themselves  Most women feel awkward at first but I remind them that the truth is that only to the extent that you are able to love and value yourself you are to love and support others
"worst end, leaving me, failing, future crumble, no desire for friends, pushed away, cry all the time, aunt died",I really love that youre taking responsibility for your pessimism here Theres a modern parable about two young brothers One child is in a room full of every toy you could imagine and hes miserable the other is in a room full of horse manure and hes flinging it around with joy So then someone comes and asks the first boy why hes so miserable because he has so much He says that hes missing the one toy that he really wants Then the brother is asked why hes so happy in a room full of manure and he says With all this sht theres gotta be a pony in here somewhereHappiness is a state of mind and I hear you saying that you used to be happy so maybe this means you believe its possible Thats a wonderful startResearch on depression shows us that it is very linked to pessimism You say I always see the worst end of things Thats pessimism Life is like an elephant If all you see is roughness backup and walk around the view will change The key to optimism is to build your ability to see the bad things in life as 1 temporary this will pass I know how to fix friendships 2 Specific not involving the whole of your life and 3 not your fault tons of people fail road tests On the flip side it helps if we can see good things as 1 more permanent 2 bleeding into other areas of our lives and 3 something YOU created Not taking credit for good things and blaming yourself for the bad ones is typical especially of women The feelings you are having are temporary youre in a slump and its a good time to sit down and look at how you can make the picture look different I think you know how but you lack energy right now If tackling this on your own isnt enough a therapist can help you take that step back to look at the big picture and help you rebuild your natural resilience and capacity for joy I wish you the best
"anxious, afraid, quiet, depressed, hated myself, need help, care for me, show they care",I agree you need more care and support No one deserves to feel alone or like they hate themselves Were all wonderful imperfect complicated people and were at our best when were all helping each other Im glad you wrote this question because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes I can tell that youre smart because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connectedyou not being yourself and then how you felt when your grandma died When Grandma died you needed and deserved extra love and support but the people around you didnt seem to give it to you maybe My hunch is that they wanted to but that they didnt know how much you needed it or what you needed exactly The older you get the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need Maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature but thats how it works When you started middle school it sounds like you changed you got more quiet right That must have felt weird to not be acting like yourself It sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldnt like you Fear can be silly So then fear got you to not show yourself and when we dont show ourselves people cant see who we are they dont know us as well and then they dont know what we need and they cant care for us as well either Fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you It does that to a lot of us So where youre at right now is because of what fear did to you and also because when Grandma died you were already isolated so people couldnt see your pain and know that you needed support Theres a simple solution but youd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say Get off my back Youre not helping me by telling me lies Can you be brave enough to go back to your old louder self If you talk to the people closest to youtell them what you think and how you feel then theyll be able to give you the care that you want and deserve I wish you well as you try this
"terrified, gave in, afraid to say no, guilt, depression",Hi Tennessee There is nothing wrong with you There are many good reasons why you didnt say no You didnt say no because you were caught off guard and unprepared there is no place in life that teaches girls or boys how to manage it when someone crashes a sexual boundary You also live in a culture where girls are encouraged to be cooperative and not upset people and to put the needs of other people first You instinctively want people to like you and people can be very coercive sexually You said it yourself you gave in He wore you downTheres nothing wrong with you It wasnt your job to say no Women arent the gatekeepers of male sexual urges It was his job to get your consent first He pressured you into it A good therapist would help you to dig deep and uncover all these barriers to saying no and more If you said no what might happen then What might that mean about you What are you avoiding feeling Unloved unwanted cold What would you have to believe in order to be confident enough to say no That you didnt have to do anything you dont want to do That youre special or that sexuality is special Would you need a better understanding of what sexual assault is I love that you want to do some work here to strengthen your sexual boundaries and I urge a widespread conversation about what consent it Men and women of all ages could use more of this training

"empty inside, feel, alive, reproduce, die",Are there any times or moments in which you feel other than empty  Start with knowing the context of when you feel something other than emptyIf there is no recent example then in your mind go back in time to think of when you felt something other than empty  Recall what you liked about this time whether you were by yourself or with others what type of activity you were involved at the time of nonemptinessHow did you come to your conclusion that your life purpose is to reproduce and die  If this is what your parents siblings and extended family believe it is possible that you have a broader view of yourself and havent yet uncovered a way of defining your own philosophy of livingGive yourself the time to browse around online or in person social meet ups on your interests  It is possible you will discover entire new areas of life and ways of considering life that are brand new to you and which connect to your true selfThis is one way of respecting your individuality which of itself may decrease your sense of emptiness
"happy, feel nothing, push people away, sick, ruining relationships",Maybe you have depressionThe name of your condition matters much less than the descriptions you wrote of how you feelSince youve observed how you sometimes interact with people and realize you arent happy with the result youve a very solid starting point for reflecting on your deeper wishes in relating to othersStart with asking reasons of yourself about the puzzling aspects of how youre engaging with othersTheorizing as to why you feel that pushing people away is easier and easier than whatGoogling the keywords of how you feel may open a starting point for ideas on knowing yourself and what you wish for
"terrible place, fix it, caught up, not knowing how, not being able to communicate, blaming him, feelings of distrust, irrational, anxiety, walk away, temporary fix",You may be pressuring yourself to be the one person who fixes the relationship  This is impossible because the relationship belongs to both of youHas he told you whether he feels about himself that how he interacts with you is contributing to problems in the coupleIs he willing to understand what youre asking of him without shutting down with whatever he is feeling when he feels blamedYour feelings of distrust are the natural outcome of not being properly heard and understood  Hes not willing to listen to you so of course youre frustrated and this frustration comes out in all sorts of uneasy feelingsWillingness to hear each other in a nondefensive way sometimes requires a couples therapists assistanceAsk your husband if hes willing to understand not judge you  Be willing yourself to do the sameIf after trying and getting nowhere youll know when to stop trying on your own as a couple and to find a specifically trained couples therapistsWarning not all therapists are trained to do couples therapy  Ask the therapist if theyve had specialized training in couples therapyOtherwise having a referee type therapy session of what do you think what do you think isnt going to do anything except frustrate both of you furtherGood luck
"feeling like going crazy, symptoms of medication",Since you realize that hearing voices in your head is not usual for you then definitely there is a problematic situation happening within your awareness of who you areif you recently started taking a new drug or increased dosage of one you already were taking and the voices started shortly after then yes it is possible medication created your problemStart by telling whoever gave you the presecription about the problem youre havingCrazy has some flexibility as to whether someone is this way or notCertainly a very positive sign that youre not crazy is that youre selfaware of a problem within yourself And youre responsible toward yourself and making effort to address this problemCrazy people usually dont do responsible behaviors
"madly in love, future plans, long distance relationship, broke up, still love her, suffered from depression, unable to connect, damaging me, my life",Hi Boise Im sorry that youve lost this love The fact that you were planning marriage and a future tells me that you meant something very special to each other at that time Its different nowyoure not together anymore but you cant accept this right Good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life Youve been grieving for longer than you were together Oh but really youve not been grievingyoure stuck still loving her instead of moving forward Unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache Lets look at some possible blocks to moving forwardIt could be that theres something unfinished for you Maybe you felt hurt and you didnt have the chance to say so or you felt you hurt her and you didnt have the chance to make it right Maybe theres a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say Maybe you want to tell her youve never stopped loving her and see if she feels the same way If this is the case you have two choices right You can reach out and say what you need to say or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go If you reach out theres no guarantee it will go well or that shell even respond Maybe write her a letter and dont send it or send itit might be worth the risk Use the next paragraph to help you decide Do you know how she feels How did it end Did she end it Was it ended just because of the distance or are there more differences between you that didnt work Sometimes people are so in love that they cant clearly see that the other person isnt in love with them anymore Use the information you have about what she wants for her lifecan you honour what she says she needs If shes asked for distance you would do well to honour thatA key to moving forward look at your thoughts and where theyre getting stuck Write it down What bad thing can happen if you let it go Or If I move forward that will mean  Keep goingwhat would be the worst part of that  This kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck placeIt is possible that youve turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future As in If this person doesnt love me then Im unlovable or No one will ever love me as much as she did So your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future Can you find another way to reject that message Try saying these things to yourselfI know she loved me There is evidence of thatI was a good partner There is evidence of thatIts part of life to fall in love and then have to move forwardI can do this and learn from itMany people like methats how I know Im lovableIts normal to feel sad Im grieving a lost loveI want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirrorI know more love awaits me if I can get fear out of the wayIf this person loved me others can too but not if Im clinging to some old memoryThese are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you I wish you well
"anger, control, girlfriend screams, deal with life, depressed, lost",Hi Campbell River You say you have anger but you dont mention how it shows Or maybe it doesnt Are you aggressive with your girlfriend Since you mention depression I wonder if youre bottling it all up somewhere instead of letting it show at all If this is the case I admire your ability to not lash out at someone whos hurting you However if they are totally  unexpressed anger turn inward and shift into depression When she yells at you what do you do Is this the moment that you feel the most angry I wouldnt be surprised anger is a normal response to someone yelling at you Something about angerits often there to cover up our more vulnerable emotions Under the anger I wonder if you feel worthless powerless scared unloved Part of the trick to reducing anger is identifying those other emotions and expressing them You say you dont know how to deal with life and I think maybe you mean you dont know how to deal with emotions Lots of people dont This is confusing for most of us What am I feeling Why is it so strong Im afraid to express it for fear of hurting someone or falling apart or feeling alone How do I know what to express and what to be quiet about These are all great questions to ask yourself and a qualified therapist can help you sort it all out and support you in your growth I wish you well
"panic attacks, anxiety, pressure on back, fears, guilt, depression, self-harming, meaningless, constant fear, happy person, hope, anxiety forever",Not having support from your family for such a significant problem is a problem itselfHow about your friends are any of them nurturing or treat you kindly when you bring up that youve got this problemAre any of your friends willing to accommodate the fact that right now youve got panic attacks from driving and being a passengerMaybe being and feeling accepted while youre in this current phase of your life would help diminish the panic attacksIf no support is coming to you then a next step would be to evaluate the relationships in your life and to develop standards and expectations of others especially that they are considerate of your great need at this timeIts possible you are bearing the emotional burden of a lot more people in your life than yourselfIf no one wants to show they care about this situation then release yourself from trying to please and satisfy everyones wish that you be better while they ignore your need for their supportBe realistic in what youre able to give back to people who want to be blind to your emotional needThinking this way will at first raise your anxiety level from fear of losing everyone  Eventually youll stabilize within yourself and know that all youre asking for is some support for having a tough time Hopefully the others will be more responsive to youIf they dont you still know that youre being reasonable for what youd like

"emotions, symptoms, situations, enjoy pain, cut myself, climax during sex, lie, rehabilitation, made love, impact in my emotions, enjoy reading, hunting, feel powerful, killing, hunt, eat, drink, flesh and blood",Im not sure that you dont feel emotion or that you are frightened of the depth of your emotions From what you write the context of your growing up years had people telling you to not feel  Little kids and babies dont remember whether or not they had emotions since birth  This is information someone told you or was part of your family systemPossibly your family was afraid of their emotions or of you knowing yoursSimilarly your comparison of being human means being monster like is not an obvious connection  Besides monsters are an idea they arent real  They embody what someone considers the worst qualities of themselves or the human species  Again I wonder whether youve taken on stories you heard growing up about how unacceptable and bad you areA way to start learning your emotions is to start in simple basic ways to ask yourself what you are feeling in the situations that you believe emotions would belongIf on the first bright sunny and warm day of the year you remind yourself to notice what youre feeling in response to this youll be taking one step toward awareness of your emotionsIf someone buys you a birthday present be aware of how you feel  Keep adding awareness to situations and see if this builds an ease with feeling emotions
"worried, stressed, daughter, on my own",Your instinct to help your daughter is naturalHow you proceed depends a lot on whether she recognizes she has a psychological and emotional problem or if only you see this from observing herAlso her age matters a lot in what way would be most likely to succeed in addressing the problems you describeIf you and your daughter have different opinions as to whether or not she has problems and she is above the legal age of when you have authority over her life then you can only suggest to her that therapy may benefit herIf your daughter is in your legal control then you can locate a counselor nearby discuss your situation with that person and depending on the outcome youd be within your parenting right to take your daughter to a counselorStarting therapy without willingness to do so is risky  The person may feel resentful enough to not participate   And sometimes the counselor is skillful enough to find a path to your daughter or any patients selfinterest and engage them in therapyFamily counseling regardless of your daughters age is another way to bring your concerns to your daughters attention in a therapy environment in which a counselor would be able to help distinguish the seriousness of your daughters psychological problem from simply a difference in viewpoints between you and your daughter in how to handle certain situationsAlso if you believe your daughter is a threat to herself then instead of this slower route get in touch with the emergency psychological assessment service in your town for a more immediate response

"cycles of depression, hits me harder, debilitating, effects of the medicine, unwillingness to move forward, despair, worried, complacent, prohibiting, anxiety, zombielike haze, no interests, inability to concentrate, regained sense of self, remaining depression, good habits, go back on the medicine",Deciding whether or not psychiatric medicine is a good option can be complicated as you have noticed and only a person who is licensed to prescribe can give you medical advice regarding medications While there is sometimes relief from symptoms from medication as you have pointed out there are often negative side effects as well While I cant give you advice on whether or not to continue medication I would urge you to take an inventory of the positive and negative effects that you have noticed and educate yourself as much as possible about the short and longterm costs and benefits of psychiatric medication If you can find a doctor psychiatrist or ARNP who is competent in mental health it may also benefit you to consult with themOne thing that I am wondering about is what is your support system like in regards to your fight against depression Are you seeing a therapist or attending any therapeutic or supportive group While there are many things that one can do on their own to work through challenges such as depression psychotherapy has been shown time and again in research to be highly effective and sometimes having a relationship with a caring competent professional who understands depression and ways of helping can make a huge difference
"lost all my friends, weird sleeping patterns, cut myself, change in locker rooms, ticked off, overreact, depressed, sad music, fake a smile, want to be happy",As silly as it may sound making sure that we are getting the right amount of restful sleep is very important when we are feeling low  The reason for this is the lack of proper sleep significantly affects our ability to problem solve and critically evaluate our situation and can lead to a domino effect in our thinking  I know you feel that you may be losing your friendships but what are the facts that have led to this belief Really ask yourself are they facts or are they your perspective on events  In regards to your coping behaviours at night it sounds very isolating and also very silenced  As opposed to the sad music why not try all music allowing yourself to experience the wide breadth of emotions that are circling within you  One of the other recommendations I would make would be to try and journal about some of those thoughts and fears in order to release them in a positively cathartic way Some of the behaviours that you have mentioned are a bit more significant though and I would recommend speaking with someone directly in the near future
"death, alone, love, someone, want, feel",Feeling alone andor isolated is almost always associated with being depressed As humans we need connection and interaction with others in order to feel satisfied Given that you are frequently thinking about death I highly recommend that you see a mental health professional as soon as possible to help assess your immediate needs and address any underlying issues that may be contributing to your feelings of loneliness and depression The good news is that with proper consistent treatment and commitment to change things can really turn around for you A therapist can work with you on building enjoyable activities into your daily routine change maladaptive thought patterns that contribute to your sadness and help with exploring what has gotten you to where you are By learning about where your sadness originates engaging in preferred activities and changing your thought patterns you should begin feeling relief from the burden of depression What will likely result is further opportunity to find social outlets and an increased ability to connect with others Dont give up Create some short terms goals that you can likely achieve and make your treatment a priority and a focus You have already taken the first step in getting better by writing to this site Keep on this path and believe in yourself Best of luck to you
"severe anxiety, depression, panic attacks, suicidal, self-harming, fear, scared, loud sounds, yelling, conflict, medication, psychiatric service dog, calming, happier, worried, help",It sounds like you have been a positive support for your fiancee There is no doubt that this situation is a great challenge for the both of you While it may feel like you are responsible for her health and happiness it is important that you understand that you on your own wont be able to resolve her mental health issues Based on what you have explained it sounds like she needs to get a medical andor psychiatric evaluation Whether or not she decides to take medication is her and your decision but keeping an open mind about treatment options is important I suggest that she see a therapist on her own in order to better understand and cope with her anxiety and depression especially given her suicidal thoughts You would also likely benefit from therapy individual or couples therapy in order to address how you are feeling and best learn how to support her and your relationship I wish the very best for both of you and hope that things will improve sooner than later
"unemployed, relocated, cant get approved, past mistakes, depressed, overwhelmed, trouble functioning, loosing partner, see no light, need help, chaos infested, call life",It sounds like you are feeling like things are hopeless and out of control and youre not sure what to do about it If you can find a competent therapist to work with together you may be able to come up with some strategies for alleviating the overwhelming distress that you are experiencing and gain some insight into what may be contributing to these challenges Additionally a therapist may be able to support you in getting back on your feet in regards to work a place to live and showing up with your partner in a way that will be more satisfying to you
"miserable, gaining weight, crying, missed my country, culture shock, academic life, never liked, never felt like I belong, go back home",It sounds like you are feeling very unsure and out of place and the prospect of continuing to feel as you do now for the remainder of schooling seems daunting Without getting to know more about you and your experiences here and at home it is hard to say what you should do however I think exploring these things with a competent therapist may help you to discover the answer
"anxiety issues, relationship, depression, vomit, emotional nightmare, semirelationship, nerve problems, fear, brighter future, medications, forums, sister, similar problems",Hi HelenaI felt a bit sad when I read this This is a new term for me semirelationship What does it mean I know that todays culture for young people is more of a hookup culture than a dating one Maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore That makes me feel sad I hear a lot of young women Im not sure youre female but thats my guess say that they struggle with hookups because they cant let themselves hope for a phone call after a hookup Research tells us that after a hookup college age women tend to feel used and unworthy and men tend to feel guilty I think this scenario works better for men than women but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the endThis is only one possible explanation for your anxietythat your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether its okay to want or expect thatMaybe take a moment and listen to anxiety Anxiety tends to try to convince us that somethings wrong with us or something bads going to happen Anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague its more difficult to refute it then but you can try to clarify its whisperings by asking yourself these questions What am I afraid of What is the worst thing that might happen here Then what might happen and what would be the worst part of that Keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen Might someone not want youmight you feel rejectedor feel not good enoughyou might get hurtThen when you find that core fear you can look at your life and I bet youd find a place where that idea or fear originated A big moment or many smaller ones when you actually DID feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt In the end its a feeling youre trying to avoid not life or relationship and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious But this doesnt work for you Good With the help of a qualified therapist you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm confidence
"emotions, hurt, love, crying, lost appetite, couldn't sleep, depressed, joy, scared, attractive, beautiful, changed, therapy",I am very sorry for the pain you are suffering Losing the most significant person in your life is extremely painful and breakups are often equated to a death There will certainly be a grieving process that you go through and time passing will allow the hurt to subside With that being said seeing a therapist is highly recommended as it sounds like continuous support may be necessary for healing to take place Anytime sadness causes thoughts of suicide or self harm it is important to get help immediately A therapist can help you by validating your feelings and what you are going through while also working with you to move through the grieving process adopt new hobbies social outlets and goals for your future While starting over and trying out new ways of being may seem like a daunting task it will only make things easier and give you a sense of hope and purpose for your future With the new year right around the corner this could be viewed as a good time and opportunity to get reaquainted with yourself and set goals related to living a more fullfilling life Hang in there With a support system in place and a healthy mindset things can only get easier Best of luck to you
"emotional mess, major depressive disorder, consequences, diagnosed, records, counselor, prohibited, antidepressants, reaction, passed out, treatment, clinic, medication, decisions, suicidal, self-help, electroshock therapy, working things out, graduated, stay positive, be happy",I admire your courage for stating your view about antidepressants  Questioning mainstream thinking and being in touch with your own views are signs of strength and clarity in a personAs a therapist I always tell my patients to avoid antidepressantsTheir effectiveness is in suppressing a persons mood and feelings  If someone does not know how they are feeling then they will have more difficulty in understanding themselves their uncertainties and hesitations and overall how they relate to others and what they expect from othersAntidepressants mask how someone feelsIn a crisis temporarily taking antidepressants may be helpful  If someone is so overwhelmed that they are not functioning then  suppressing unhappy feelings so that the person can get through a day may be of benefit for a short whileBasically respect and follow your own opinion about antidepressants   Your view is shared by many   It is a minority opinion and very valid If you would like to shop for a therapist ask the person on the phone what their opinions are about antidepressantsIdeally you will eventually find a therapist who thinks in a way which is similar to you or at least similar enough that you will have a sense that you are able to trust working with them on whatever you define as problematicI hope you will have an easy and productive therapist search
"no real friends, girlfriend who irritates me, loves me to death, push her away, pushes me away, going through a breakup, nobody",Having time all to yourself may be necessary so you have time to reflect on your own identity and values become more clear on what matters most to you and with this increased selfunderstanding be able to attract people who will feel like satisfying friendsHaving a relationship with someone whom you push away and are pushed away with someone who is irritating seems to have limited benefit for each of youMaybe you are together from fear of being alone and being alone is exactly what you may now need in your life in order to draw more favorable people to you
"hospitalized twice, psychiatric help, struggling, fighting negative thoughts, irrational fears, loneliness, people around me, not helping",If you are someone who usually has a job pays or contributes to household bills and generally manages your own daily life then here are some suggestionsStart with small changes in your life so that you will feel successful in developing little areas of personal happinessSince the people whom you currently are in your life arent helping much consider branching out your life so that you are with those with whom you do feel help youFollow your natural interests  If you like reading look online for a local book club   If you like watching birds look up a bird watching groupSocial isolation increases the intensity of negative feelingsAlso the way healthcare is set up in the US psychiatrists spend 15 minutes asking a person questions and then giving them a pill script    There is almost no human interest in the personIf youd like feeling better as a person then find people   Relying only on our mental health system will keep you feeling low and unsteadyIf your life is a little more sheltered and you are in a group home setting or your basic needs are taken care of by someone or some organization then similar advice is still validFind and participate in whatever human settings which appeal to you and are available on a somewhat regular basis
"divorce, wife, known since 4th grade, involved for seven years, baby, mother, lived with, heart broken, depression, haven't seen child, good dreams, bad dreams, feel hated, help, intervene, speak with someone",Its hard to accept the end of a marriage when its not your choice you feel powerless abandoned and unwanted Your wife has the right to decide not to be in a marriage with you and a therapist can help you accept and move through this change that has broken your heart and left you lost You dont indicate why you havent seen your child and you may want to consult with a lawyer about the laws in your area and how to gain access to your baby Therapists dont intervene in these ways The marriage may be ending but your role as a loving father is only beginning  You can focus on giving your child the gift of two parents who respect each other
"ADHD, manic depression episodes, anger management problems, ODD, bipolar, split personality, truly happy",The ADHD and manic depressive episodes are terms other people told you that you haveYou dont have to accept these words to describe who you areA lot of mental health in our country is about telling people whats wrong with them and giving pills for these so called conditions instead of helping a person know more about themselves in order to make good decisionsYou can be happy because nothing from the outside such as the names people have used to tell you who you are can interfere with your own wish to be happyOthers can slow you down because of the selfdoubt and hurt feelings  No one can take happiness from you only they can make it harder to find and hold ontoAnger management only works temporarily because it is a surface approachThink of the reason you are angry  This will be better to know so you will be able to address itThen you will not have anger to manage
"narcissist sociopath, general manager, financially drained, emotionally drained, lost spirit, happy person, loner, moved to another state, working as a server, believe less in myself, pity for myself, money problems, hard time, need help",Congratulations on leaving your marriageIt is ok and natural to feel sadness loss uncertainty in direction hurt resulting from ending the marriagePossibly what you consider pity is a combination of these feelingsBe kind and caring toward who you are since you just put yourself through a major separation and need time to clear out the old emotions that connected you to your exThere is very very little chance of him helping you since he lacks compassion and empathyMore likely any help he gave would be in order to manipulate youMaybe for now your server job is ok do you have more time to concentrate on taking care of your emotionsYou were a manager once you can be a manager again when you feel ready for doing soGood luck

"manic depression, recurring nightmares, avoid similar feeling, very bad, last summer",A PTSD diagnosis requires an event which occurred at least 6 months prior to the symptoms   Depression is a common symptom of PTSD but depression can come from many other sources as well  In the end diagnoses are systems of behavioral labels  If you believe that one label PTSD is worse than another Depression you are creating a false hierarchy   Consider consulting a CBT therapist such as the fine clinicians listed in AcademyofCTorg  You may also want to look at my book Living Yes for many ideas about challenging your thinking and improving you mood wwwLivingYesorg I hope you feel better soon  Mark  wwwMarkMorrisLCSWcom and wwwLivingYesorg

"horribly ended, abandoned, emotionally wrecked, closure, depressed like states, too busy, genuinely busy, dont want to be around",Frequently when working with clients I utilize the ABC model developed by Albert Ellis the founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Theory The theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event For instance here is an exampleA Action or Event You need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you backB Behavior or Response You begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or I am not important to this personC Consequence You feel depressedIf you look at the model B has a direct effect on C The thought is if you change your reaction to A then C will have a better consequence such asA stays the sameB this is what you change This person must be busy they will call me back when they get a chance or I can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is availableC Decreased feelings of depression  overall functioning improvesThis is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve If this model resonates with you I recommend Feeling better getting better staying better by Alber Ellis In addition looking for support groups in your area are a great source of support when you are feeling abandoned or alone
"happy, excited, staying up late, sleeping too much, feeling worthless, no interest, staying in room, want to be happy, want to be nice",Im sorry to hear that you are feeling as if youre in a slump First of all nothing is wrong with you Many people report similar symptoms Have you ever talked with a physician regarding your symptoms Two extreme emotions such as feeling extremely happy and then feeling extremely low for a length of time may indicate a mood disorder I think it would be best to talk with your doctor or a therapist to help pinpoint the issue causing themIts possible that it could just be certain stressors in your life that are causing the two extremities but you definitely want to rule out any mental health issues If it is in fact mental health related there are many medications or therapy choices that can help Thanks for reaching out I hope that you will feel back on track soon
"depression, better, anxiety, social isolation, hard to get over",The best way to handle depression and anxiety is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor and therapy to help you understand the thoughts feelings and behaviors that are causing the depression and anxiety in the first place and then to replace these with more positive thoughts and behaviors This is not something that anyone should just white knuckle and try to get through on their own with no help Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety This takes a therapist trained in CBT There are some things in life that you cannot change and must learn to accept A lot of people spend time trying to change things that they have no control over This may be the behavior of someone else in your life or it could be a situation that you cannot change such as the recent death of a loved one a lost relationship or an accident or illness which has left you handicapped In cases like this what can change is your attitude and thoughts about the situation that you now find yourself in One thing that is inevitable about life is that stuff happens and it is not always pleasant Some people take these unpleasant occurrences very hard and it throws them into a deep depression Other people seem to be able to handle lifes ups and downs and bounce back They do this with having positive coping skills in their life Learning new coping skills is something your therapist can help you withA lot of people are so focused on trying to change the things in their life that they cannot change and are ignoring the things that they can change There are things that you can do Here is a quote for you to consider You are getting almost everything that you are getting based on the choices that you have made You will continue to get the same thing out of life until you make some changes Another quote I like is You will find a way or you will find an excuse Dont ever say that you have no choice Everyone has a choice You might not particularly like any of the choices that you are facing but you do have choices Not happy in a relationship You can leave it Hate your job Get a new one If it matters to you you will find a way Dont sit there complaining about everything but not doing anything different or betterTake care of yourself Exercise is very important not only for your physical health but for your mental health as well Eating right and exercising will help you feel better about yourself Also find a meditation that works for you There are progressive muscle relaxation exercises visual and mental meditations and many many more Start making some positive changes in your life today You can do it

"married for 3 years, two kids, cheated on, hurt, lowest, communicating, What do I do",Hi there Thank you reaching out for help It takes a lot of courage for someone that is being abused to reach out for help I want you to know that I am here to help you in any way that I can First and foremost you did not mention whether or not you had children yourself by this man Im going to assume there are So the most important thing right at this moment is asking yourself if you and your children are safe Is the boyfriend currently living in the home or is he coming and going If he is coming and going or currently living in the home my suggestion for you to is to pack a bag for you and your children and go somewhere safe ie family members home friend or a shelter temporarily I cannot stress this enough Although some people tend to minimize their abusers behavior ie they only do it when they are drinking they only do it when they are mad its those individuals that find themselves or their children in a serious situation So you can never take abuse physical or mental lightly because you never know what is going through that persons mind at that particular time Its always better to be safe than sorry Secondly it will not be safe helpful or productive to attempt to talk to the abuser about your relationship Abusers often times try and manipulate you into staying by apologizing or attempting to justify their behaviors This is the time you would want to go see a magistrate in order to get a protective order for you and your childrenIts unfortunate that your significant other was involved with another women causing pregnancy however that is no longer your concern Your concern at this point is keeping yourself and your children safe I would also suggest counseling for you and your children in order to work through these issues I hope this was helpful and please stay safe and take care of yourself
"angry, can't deal with people, nervous, scared, lay awake at night, thinking, conversations in my head, making myself feel terrible, crying, more conversations in my head, don't know what's wrong, feel this way.",What you are experiencing is totally normal and these emotions mean you are human Humans are social creatures who were created to be in connection with others but sometimes our life experiences or genetics can make that more difficult for some of us It is possible that these reactions are based on negative reactions you have had with others in the past maybe your family or other traumatic interactions with others It is also possible that they are caused by an underlying condition such as anxiety or depression which may cause you to be more uncomfortable around others or annoyed by others Some people are also more bothered by crowded spaces loud interactions and the actions of others Of course you prefer animals me too they provide unconditional love and support do not judge you and do not require you to have conversations with them The fact that you have conversations in your head at night tells me that although you say you do not like people you are craving some social connection What is probably the case is that you were never really taught how to interact and have those conversations The good news is that there is nothing wrong with you you just need a little help learning how to have these conversations and taking some healthy risks to initiate conversations and that is something that I help many of my clients with in therapy
"life after death, raised in a religion, live on forever, hell or heaven, overwhelmed, living forever, thoughts, panic, anxiety, crazy, not normal",You might be surprised how normal you are Anxiety is incredibly common and while your particular type of existential anxiety might be unique to you  it is very difficult for most people to really comprehend what happens after we die  regardless of the religious or philosophical belief systems we hold It is the ultimate unknown and some philosophers and psychologists believe that at the root of our daytoday anxieties is the fear of death or fear of the unknown  Just as it can be really hard to comprehend the ending of life it can also be hard to comprehend an eternal existence What these both have in common is that we are imaging a future that is ultimately unknowable and this unknown can provoke a lot of anxiety Mindfulness based practices like meditation  maybe there is something like this in your religious tradition  can be very helpful in making peace with the unknown in the present moment The more we can learn to live in the moment  the less we get hung up on anticipating outcomes for our lives that may never come true Mindfulness practices can help you ground be where you are  relax and regulate your nervous system so that you are able sleep and recuperate and train your attention to focus on living the life you want to live now  rather than worrying about what happens after you die Having said all that  it can be profoundly helpful to speak with someone about your anxiety  especially when you feel haunted by it worry that you are crazy and cant get to sleep There are lots of good therapists out there who can help you with your anxiety
"nervous, anxious, scared, before sex",Tell your partner about this so that ideally the person has a chance to be supportive and reassuring as well as listen to your specific worries and fearsInitiate this type of discussion at a time which is removed from the time youre about to have sexThis way you and your partner both have a chance to realize the two of you are having a discussion  not a prelude to sexIf you meant in your question that you feel anxious about having sex w a random partner then maybe you are less interested in hookup sex than you imagined
"school back then, transferred to another school, changing my job",Theres a quote I love that says Wherever you go there you are and the book by the same name by Jon KabatZinn may be very helpful for you The thing about changing things up when they get tough is that they often arent the things that need changing The awesome and challenging thing about it is that when you work on the internal aspects that may need attention you can learn to find a sense of centeredness that comes with practicing mindfulness and asking yourself who you really are and want to be Through this deeper work you can actually be in the midst of chaos and still feel that calm and peace within yourself If you look for support in this journey from a counselor or therapist Id recommend looking for someone offering Acceptance and Commitment Therapy ACT or MindfulnessBased Cognitive Behavioral Therapy MCBT Also helpful may be the online program of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction MSBR found here There are inperson programs across the country but this online selfguided version is free and a great resource

"emotions, symptoms, situations, focusing, randomly think, hear something, unsure, comment, asked, do something",Anxiety can absolutely make you think you heard something about you When we are on high alert we tend to look for threats and often the greatest threats we experience on a daily basis are social in nature  To some extent this is normal for example when people experience late onset deafness they often will worry people are talking about them and usually not good things because our brains tend to jump to that Of course Im not saying you are going deaf or anything just giving an example Counseling can help you work through this anxiety It may also be helpful to reach out to a counselor to rule out if there may be other things going on Sometimes things like paranoia can blend in with anxiety which is a very distressing experience But both are absolutely treatable Wishing you the best
"dreams of men, try to hurt me, bad, wake at 430, wake at 445, stay awake by 600, last one to fall asleep, hate falling asleep, longest without sleep, three days",That is awful I am sure you are ready to start getting some rest Its normal for us to wake a few times in the night however when we are dealing with high anxiety or stress those times can turn into being up most night Given that you are having these repeated dreams I am wondering what might be going on in your life either now  or in the past that could be triggering stress or maybe memories It can help to draw the dream out in the morning or even to look for metaphor In the long run seeking counseling can help you sort all that outIn the meantime selfsoothing strategies may help you in the night when you wake and cant get back to sleep This can be anything with your sensesgetting a snack like tea and focusing on that taste smelling something pleasant listening to some relaxing music looking through a magazine taking a shower Anything you can think of that might help you relax If it involves needing to get up thats okay Getting out of bed can actually help you get out of that mind space and helps you associate your bed with relaxationsleep vs anxiety making it more likely you will fall asleep once  you lay down
"lost, sad, unwanted, forgotten, separation anxiety, cope, break up, love, challenge, tough, out of town, travels, new job, not used to, acting this way, keep me up to date, talk with me",Relationships at any amount of distance can be so hard It makes sense that you are encountering more anxiety than usual given that major change in your relationship And youre right that being separated from our partners can heighten our insecurities and worries about not only our relationship security but about our partners interest Have you talked with your boyfriend about this struggle youre feeling It can be hard to have this kind of conversation without triggering a sense of blame and subsequent defensiveness in our partners but it really is possible If you have any concerns about being able to do this then a session or two with a local counselor or therapist might be really helpful  and it really can be just about finding the way to share what youre feelingAs far as coping with anxiety there are a lot of options but I highly recommend an app called SelfHelp for Anxiety Management Theres so much good information in this app to help you learn to pay attention to what kinds of thoughts are helpful or unhelpful and there are also lots of activities for calming down and decreasing the intensity of that anxiety The best part is its free
"panicked, guilty, envelope containing several hundred dollars, cowardly act, atone, random acts of kindness, karma",From your writing you have already atoned for what you describe as cowardlyRecognizing your action and trying to directly correct it realizing your action was improper and demonstrating the willingness to take right action are all examples of making things rightSince the actual driver is unavailable to consult as to their wishes on what they expect and feel would correct the matter you did the next best thing and considered the situation from the driver point of view
"horrible anxiety, can't sleep, sense of doom, hard to breathe, feel like nothing, makes it better",Anxiety is usually a sign of a current problem to which familiar emotional patterns of feeling similarly upset attach themselvesTry to understand more about who you are what you like feel uneasy about especially your deeper emotions of being emotionally harmed or injured by meaningful peopleAnxiety is best addressed indirectly by understanding and kindly accepting previous hurt and fears from long agoOnce you feel at ease with dynamics of past situations then the current anxiety will decrease  This is because you will have adjusted and found new ways of handling otherwise frightening and overwhelming interactions and involvements with others
"cry, trouble, not knowing, what is wrong, emotions, symptoms, situations",Maybe you need more time to reflect and organize your thoughtsTry to figure out what would make you feel more relaxed about talking to your dad or stepmomAlso its possible you simply dont feel safe around either of them and so intuitively realize youre better off not talking with them about a delicate matterDepending on whether you trust talking to dad and stepmom you may simply wish to excuse yourself from speaking about yourselfTheres no good reason to be heartfelt with people whom you dont feel are willing to accept or understand who you are
"anxiety, terrified, anxiety attack, new, travel far away, job, family, need, road",Anxiety can cause such a feeling of discomfort in our bodies that it can seem unbearable The concern that I can hear in what you have written is that the thought of having some anxiety has now left you uncomfortable with any anxiety at all  and that can become a problem indeed As opposed to thinking about your anxiety as something much bigger than you it could be helpful to start breaking it down What are the things specifically that cause you anxiety about this new job Is it being away from your family If so why Once you start breaking down what causes you to feel anxiety into smaller mouthfuls then we are far better able to understand what has led to discomfort and start to problem solve the issue
"broke up, needy, unsure, losing my mind, anxiety, validation, content, at peace",Hello  What you are experiencing is entirely reasonable for someone that is still trying to adjust to a new life and also leave behind a long term relationship  It sounds like you lost touch with who you were as a person and need to start exploring that side of you again  Spend time doing things that you have been putting off or did not do because you were involved  Take the time to become one with yourself before you get into another serious relationship  Regaining selfconfidence on yourself will help you with all other areas of life  It is time to make you a priority and to start focusing on your mental and physical well being  Get connected with your community and find things you would want to do that give you purpose and lift you  Before too long you will be in your way to being content and in total control of your mind and at peace  Best of luck Mirella
"anxiety symptoms, not going out, following parent, can't go into stores, grocery stores, on the phone with dad, forget things",Despite your anxiety you are highly attuned to your sense of well being and skillful in articulating the details of when anxiety takes overSometimes people who anxious in specific realtime situations are helped by talking themselves through the anxietyMaybe youd be able to distract yourself from the grocery store anxiety by telling yourself youre anxious and that youll be ok its only a grocery storeThe longer term way to dissolve anxiety is through selfacceptance selflove selfbelief basically all the areas of trusting yourself to handle situationsAnxiety is a fear of being overwhelmed by a circumstance or condition which ends badly for youOften the person can very well handle the situation about which theyre anxious   The problem is not trusting themselves enough to rely on their self knowledge

"scared, meet people, dont know, relatives, raise my hand, talk in school, no one understands, handle this",Social Anxiety is scary You dont feel safe in relationships and prefer to isolate yourself from the outside world Is it something you can talk to your parents about A school counselor could help you The counselor could possibly order an evaluation to determine how to helpBuild your self confidence  Start slow with your family and identify a subject you are familiar with and add to a general conversation Its important to start finding things in common with others You dont need to carry the conversations just add a phrase or two Have an exit strategy if you get too uncomfortable Keep notes of what worked and what didnt work so youll be prepared for your next opportunity Carpe Diem
"paranoia, breathe heavy, sweat a lot, act weird, fight my paranoia, panic attacks, people staring, acting scared, threat, pervert, predator, hurt a kid, scared to be around them, bad person, make this stop",In our practice many people we see have unwanted thoughts of doing harm to children  physically or sexually As you said these are intrusive and unwanted thoughts  not genuine desires to harm them This is a form of OCD we often call Harm or Pedophilic OCD What you are describing here as paranoia sounds similar to this and is so demoralizing because you are dealing both with the distress of these unwanted thoughts and feelings as well as the fear and uncertainty about your own character as a good personIf this is really what is going on further assessment by the right professional would determine this the current gold standard approach to addressing OCD is Exposure with Response Prevention  in this case confronting the feared situations thoughts or images on purpose rather than avoiding them until they lose the fear and shame associated with them
"known for six years, dated off and on, hadn't seen in close to three years, started seeing again, want this to last, stayed the night, text, call, make contact, left his house",It is possible your question reflects some insecurity about whether or not either or you would like this relationship to continueOtherwise the answer to your question would appear naturally  If you genuinely feel close enough to this person to sleep with him then who texts whom first wouldnt really matter too muchTry to understand within yourself whether you feel truly interested in this person as much as you would like to feel toward someone
"homecoming, uncomfortable, people, by myself",Hi Im Amelia Oh that is so frustrating Have you ever heard of social anxiety Sounds like you may be suffering from it Here is a link to a quiz httpswwwpsycomnetsocialanxietytestBesides being a therapist I am a Mom to 10 kids A couple of my kids are very uncomfortable with crowds and become very anxious Find yourself a therapist who can assess you and spend time with you to address these issues and to help you learn tools to help you navigate these emotionsI am wishing you the best
"fear, early teens, afraid, meet someone, feel afraid",Maybe the problem is learning to trust yourself to not be afraid other peopleReflect on what you believe would increase your trust of believing your own judgement on whom to trustIf youve had any type of violation during your growing up years or witnessed someone in your family be violated emotionally physically or through some terrible accident or incident then you may hesitate to believe other people are safe and not to be fearedGive yourself plenty of time and reassurance that as long as you are making sincere effort to increase you comfort around other people eventually you will succeed
"autism diagnosis, stopped working, take care, abusive relationship, mentally, physically, emotionally, live like a recluse, feel nervous, comfortable around people",Theres a lot of layers there to your situation and Im focusing on two layers that may be contributing to your feelings of discomfort around others  One layer is the daunting news that your son has autism  Many parents can feel overwhelmed and distraught with this diagnosis  The vast array of treatments available is daunting in and of itself at times to wrap ones head around  Taking time to reflect or seek out therapy regarding how this diagnosis has impacted you may be helpful  Some parents feel their individual identity gets lost in the diagnosis because they have dropped everything to help their child and others may experience guilt  If either of these or other feelings come to the forefront for you it may be worth working through them with a therapist  A support group list is available through wwwautismspeaksorg and may help connect you with others raising children with autismA second layer is the abusive relationship you were involved in  The trauma you experienced in this relationship may have a very meaningful impact on your ability to trust and to be intimate with others  Engaging with a therapist can help facilitate the healing process as well as paving the way for more comfortable and trusting relationships
"heart races, words physically cannot come out, nervous, sitting in car, find courage, enter Target",It is possible that you could have or be developing an anxiety disorder There isnt really enough information provided here to suggest a particular disorder but it might be worth meeting with a counselor or therapist to do a formal assessment Some of the questions they might ask could be what other kinds of physical symptoms you experience how frequently these physical symptoms happen whats going on for you when they tend to happen and how frequentlyintensely you find yourself worrying in general Anxiety itself is a really natural thing  its just when it starts interfering with your ability to do life the way you want that we start to consider potential disorders It might be that for the most part the anxiety you feel is normal and you simply have some triggers that intensify it more than usual Working on your own or with the support of a counselortherapist to both address those triggers at the root and also to develop ways of managing the actual anxiety symptoms This twofold approach can be really helpful for not letting anxiety keep you from engaging in life the way youd like
"fear of embarrassing myself, avoid situations, meet new people, large groups of people, parties, constantly judge me",Hello and thank you for your question First I want you to know that you are certainly not alone on this issue Everyone at some point in time has a fear of public embarrassment But for many people this fear can become so awful that it begins to have a real negative impact on their quality of life  They will try to avoid any situation that they even THINK will cause them embarrassment or anxiety Escaping a possible embarrassing moment by avoiding or isolating may cause some relief at first but then many times the avoidance will eventually lead to loneliness isolation and even despair By avoiding we can also miss out on things that make us feel alive and bring enjoyment There are many selfhelp books that offer advice on this issue You can do an internet search and I recommend reading the reviews of the book That is  great way to find out if others have found the book helpful Another option is to seek a counselor to help you with this fear I would recommend a counselor who specializes in helping people who have anxiety or social anxiety Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is  a good choice for helping with anxiety but there are many others The truth is that anxiety and fear of embarrassing ourselves is not something that any of us will ever get over but we can learn to respond to those feelings differently A colleague may offer some other advice as well Be wellRobin Landwehr DBH LPC NCC
"anxiety, anxious, cheating, feelings for an ex, worrying",Would you worry less if you and your partner had a plan as to when you will be together as a coupleLong distance relationships are not for everybody   Some people need the daily or frequent interaction to feel secureThe question is not so much how to deal with anxiety that your partner is cheating on you than whether your own emotional and relationship requirements are satisfied with a long distance relationshipAnyway cheating has nothing to do with distance since married people cheat while living together for years under the same roof
"fall asleep, sit up, walk around",Maybe you are afraid to let go of your problems for a few hoursAlthough you didnt write this usually what keeps people awake or prevents them from falling asleep are worries about certain situations in their livesIf this describes you then maybe talk with yourself to convince you that you are entitled to a good nights sleepReally we all are and feeling rested from the day and lifes tensions will better you to handle whatever the particular matters areAlso maybe you will be more enthusiastic to go to bed if you have a comfy mattress and nice pillows  Make your bed an inviting place because this will tempt you to enjoy relaxing enough to go to sleep
"severe anxiety, tried everything, makes it worse, emotional support animal",Sorry to read of your sufferingIs it actually permitted that people are able to take support animals to schoolI see your point of the animal helping you  I just also see the point that some people have allergies to animal hair or dander or may feel distracted by an animal in the classroomYou may end up feeling worse if when you bring your support animal to school that it disturbs people or interferes with the routines of the classFor your anxiety I suggest some loving kindness toward yourself  Be patient with yourself and that you have anxiety  If youre able to accept that some situations create great discomfort for you maybe youll tolerate these difficult situationEmbrace your anxiety as part of you basically rather than trying to banish it which because it actually is part of you is impossible to achieveIn a way Im suggesting you become your own support animal  Love yourself be kind to yourself and see if you feel a little less stressed in school
"paranoid person, danger, horror movie, worsens at night, scared in own home, desperate",One approach is to be more accepting of yourself as someone who has fearsIt is much easier to manage a problem when youre not fighting yourself for having a problemOnce you are willing to accept this quality within yourself you may start to feel a little more relaxed about handling the fears when they ariseOne answer is to examine the facts about the fears   Ask yourself fact based questions as to how you would handle the worse case scenario of your fearsFeeling prepared whether or not the circumstance is highly unlikely to happen may increase your peace of mind with living the great fears within your mind
"scared, touch a girl, young adult, virgin, scared, have sex, mess everything up, wants a baby",Your question is a good oneThe best way to decrease the fear would be to talk with your fiancee about it   Eventually shell find out and better to talk about it when there is less pressure than to be in the midst of a situation which frightens youAlso she may feel similar to you who knowsDiscussing a topic which relates directly to your relationship is a good way to increase emotional intimacy  And emotional intimacy has a lot to do with feeling at ease with physical intimacy
"feel this way, dont understand, happening",The short answer I could give is that we dont know why its happening The longer answer could come from deeper exploration as to your fears or anxieties that you experience maybe just thinking of going outside But any sort of exploration about this almost HAS to begin with an agreement within you and all of your feelings thats its not something to be ashamed of If we are ashamed of any of our behaviors then we lose the ability to sit with them and see where they are coming from This could be something that can be worked through in therapy and specifically with a therapist who specializes in anxiety and more specifically agoraphobia
"peaceful person, thoughts about killing people, cry, feel like this",Maybe because you have great emotional pain stored inside you of which you are not aware existsSometimes people who feel greatly hurt by others or who feel unloved by others imagine if they do the opposite of love which is to kill that they will get the recognition and acknowledgement from others which they wish would come to them in a loving wayThis is my theory it is not necessarily a definitive description of your inner dynamicMost important is to keep an open mind to selfdiscovery on your feelings including the ones which are uneasy such as killing to consider
"shake, panic attacks",One way to understand panic attacks is as a sign of feeling insecure or lacking confidence in a certain area or characteristic of yourselfThe insecurity can sometimes feel overwhelming and this starts the sense of panic One way to build your sense of security within yourself is to have a simple life and a slow paced life   When there are many activities or involvements to pay attention then it is easy to not give full attention to all of them  This may trigger a sense of insecurity since in fact you may not have had sufficient time to study and know your own opinion about all of what your life is immersed inA simpler life of fewer activities allows more time to know and understand your own inner feelings and reactionsTo know more about yourself may help build your confidence and security in your ability to know and live what goes on in your life
"feeling like myself, upset, anxious, burnt out, feel better",Does it help to put a name to the experience you are having Where you first said Ive been upset for no reason and feeling anxious you then say that you are feeling burnt out which gives a little more context to what may have once felt like no reason Perhaps you are feeling burnt out That is a big deal and please try not to take it lightly When we get burnt out I have found that its from one of two things either we are not doing what we want or we are doing too much either of something we want or something we dont doesnt really matter once we get into doing too muchIf either of those rings true for your experience try as much as possible to sit with the experience and get a better sense of where the burn out is coming from I wrote about burnout for a newsletter and it is on my website I dont want to do shameless promotion but I thought it could also add to helping you httpsdavidkleintherapycommyexperienceswithburnoutI hope that you can also see that its not an abnormal experience
"fear, face fear, overcome, don't know, what can I do",Fears are not that difficult to deal with first you need to train yourself to relax using some relaxation strategy once you are able to employ that in your daily life you then need to start facing your fear for instance Ill use an example of a man who has a fear of driving over a bridge We would build a hierarchy of fears that is a list of fears ranging from least to most for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique then moving closer to the bridge then maybe standing on a bridge all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge or you can also engage in flooding which is for example if you were scared of an elevator go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore in the movie Batman Begins Bruce Wayne who has a great fear of bats goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them Secondly look at your fears do they even need to be worked on some fears are healthy for example if i was a therapist in New York City and someone came to me and said Im scared of snakes I would probably say that is OK because there are very little snakes left in ManhattanHope that helps C
"voices in my head, hearing voices, not normal, fight the voices, want them to stop, make the voices stop",How is your life going overallSince you hear voices since you were young I wonder whether you mean the thoughts each of us has about what to do our opinions including selfcriticism and praiseI try to understand how severe a problem these voices are if youve managed to get to a point in life of awareness about the voicesUsually when mental health people hear about voices the immediate thought is you need drugs bc you are psychoticSince this is going on for a number of years I wonder if the problem is something different
"anxiety, rough childhood, hit my head, walls and floors, behavior change, help myself, not realize",Give yourself a lot of empathy and care for having had a rough childhood and realizing that life can be better than how you were treated when growing upBe patient with yourself too bc lasting change takes time Alternatives to hitting your head require constant gentle reminders to do these new behaviors or if youve discovered a satisfying alternative in one moment time is required for you to repeat this alternative until it feels naturalAnxiety usually means someone did not feel well understood growing up and was rushed to comply with the wishes of others who were a regular part of their livesAnxiety lessens as the person starts to know and accept their wishes and needs as valid  Allow yourself to learn who you truly are in the spirit of accepting whatever you discover about yourselfThe behaviors will naturally change with your new understanding and self acceptanceGood luck and enjoy this self discovery project
"issues, work through, afraid, do not trust, therapists, horrible experience, dealing with grief, guilt, losing sons, drug use, complicated, traumatic relationship issue, severe anxiety, fear",I am sorry that you had this experience Therapy should be a healthy positive experience off g growth You have the right to look for certain high qualities in a therapist and finding the right one Each therapist is bound by a code of ethics and clients should have high expectations You are trusting them to guide support and help you achieve the absolute best outcome and success You should never be or feel judged and you should feel comfortable and feel as though your therapy process is moving along with YOUR GOALS IN MIND Speaking as a therapist I encourage my clients to always let me know how they feel even if they disagree with me they also have the right to inform me if something Im doing simply is not working for them communication is critical in maintaining a healthy therapeutic alliance therapeutic relationship Im able to offer ways of thinking and strategies to my clients they may not have thought of Its important to listen to my clients Its also critical for clients to feel they can share in a environment that feels safe non judgmental and confidentialRemember you are the driver in your healing process you should be the one in control because you know what your life struggles are Speaking as a therapist Im here to guide my clients toward achieving their goals encouraging and empowering my clients in what is meaningful to them to achieve You should feel comfortable speaking your thoughts my advice would look one who open hearing toy feel even its regarding them a therapist That they are open to feedbackWith all of that being said it will take time to trust again but remember ask questions and communicate with the next therapist  share  your experience and how it made you feel and that trust and being spoken  in a respectful  non judgemental and non condnscending way is critical for you Be honest clearly state your expectations from start  I offer free 50 minute first sessions for clients The reason I do this is because I feel that clients deserve opportunity observe the environment ask me questions and have the opportunity to determine their level of comfort and decide if its a good fit Other therapists sometimes offer the similar try finding one willing to offer a  consultation as that could give you the opportunity to feel things out and set forth expectationsThe article below is an excellent article about what to look for in a therapist It is worth your time reading because you are WORTH FINDING THE BEST HELP AVAILABLE This article was written based on both evidence from research and clinical experience I would strongly encourage anyone searching for help to read this and even use it as your guide I hope this was helpfulhttpswwwpsychologytodaycombloginsighttherapy20160310waysspotgoodtherapistLaura Cassity LMSW LMAC
"afraid, don't understand",Your fear is somewhat reasonable  No one wants to be raped and I imagine everyone is afraid of what being raped would feel likeDo you mean that this fear is on your mind more often than you would likeIf this is the case then try understanding the reason behind your fearIs it because you personally know or know of someone who was raped  One general direction of what would help is to regain confidence in your decisions of keeping yourself safe  The more you trust yourself to avoid social situations with lots of drinking isolated physical surroundings and being in isolated locations with someone with whom youre not very familiar probably your fear will decreaseThe other general direction to understand is if in your family history people have been violated severely either emotionally mentally or physicallyIn families in which people have suffered severe violations of themselves often the emotional patterning of expecting to be hurt by others plants itself very deeply and transmits to the younger generationIts possible then that you are suffering from fears established in other family members who have not yet been able to fully understand and accept their own sufferingThe good news is that individual therapy with a credentialed and licensed therapist is ideal for a safe place to open and clear this type of emotional burden
"attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, anxiety, anger, memory problems, can't work, no income, on medicine, feel worthless, want to be normal",I am so sorry to hear that you are struggling  It sounds like youve had a traumatic experience that has impacted your life in many ways  Without knowing much about your history I wonder if the trauma you suffered has lead to the anxiety anger and memory problems you are dealing with in addition to PTSD  I would encourage you to look for a trauma therapist who offers a sliding scale or pro bono services  There may also be community mental health services in your area that offer free therapy if you are eligible for grant
"feel like myself, think straight, stuttering, remember anything, get nervous, talk myself down, fighting, hate",Hi Houston Okay somethings definitely going on right My gut is to start with your family physician because you have some physical symptoms While it seems anxiety is a likely problem here your doctor will hopefully know your history and can help you decide if you need some medical tests or some therapy Without knowing more thats all I can say at this point Best of luck
"restraining order, exfiancé, mentally abusive, verbally abusive, nerves, sick, rock, fine",Hello and thank you for your question You may be right your physical symptoms of getting sick to your stomach may very well be your nerves or anxiety That is totally normal and understandable given your circumstances Another thing that is not unusual is that you feel better when you sit and rock That is actually a fairly common way that many people comfort themselves in times of high stress If you are concerned that there is an actual physical illness causing these symptoms you may want to visit your primary care provider They may tell you that they dont see anything physically wrong with you and at that point you may want to visit a counselor about the symptoms and your relationship experience A visit with a counselor may be a good idea either way I work as a counselor in primary care and I promise you that many people have very real physical symptoms when they have gone through abuse Unexplainable stomach and headaches are very common Sometimes with counseling those physical symptoms actually stop Be well and I hope you feel better soonRobin J Landwehr DBH LPCC NCC
"dealing with, overly emotional, refuses to offer help, therapy, seeing a doctor, panic attack, faking for attention, hypochondriac, get better",I dont know how old you are but in Pennsylvania if you are over 14 you can have therapy without your parents consent If you are young enough to use their insurance that could be complicated but depending on the state there may be ways to work around that as well If transportation is a problem call a local mental health agency and see if they can connect you with assistanceIn the meantime try searching for a phone helpline in the county where you live They may be able to help you figure out where you can get helpAnother idea is that if you are in school your guidance counselor may be able to provide links to where you can go for help He or she may also be able to give you more specific ideas to help with your panic attacksI know you said your mom refuses to offer help which included seeing a doctor but I wonder if she trusts the doctors that is your primary care physician also called a family doctor who you see when you have a minor medical ailment that may need medication That doctor may be able to help you as wellSome of the information here may be helpful to you because it explains some of what anxiety is and there are some quizzes there that may give you information to discuss with a doctor or therapist when you get connected with one httpwwwwebmdcomanxietypanicguidementalhealthanxietydisorders This may give you other information to speak with your mom about Remember that Im not asking you to actually diagnose yourself with one of these things but just offering some basic information that may help you be able to talk about what is going onIf you are having a panic attack or having a moment of anxiety try focusing on different things in the room around you It may help to shift your focus briefly outside of what you are feeling and that may lessen the feeling a bit Also remember that sometimes anxiety leads to more anxiety about having a panic attack in the future Remember that they usually and after a few minutesIt would also be helpful for you to keep track of what leads up to your anxietyBest wishes to you and keep trying until you get connected to someone
"anxiety attacks, big anxiety attacks, calms me down, up the dose, abusing them, very big anxiety attacks, stay on the 05mg, deal with the attacks, afraid, put me on something else",Do you think youre abusing xanaxIt is a highly addictive drug so maybe one reason you feel compelled to take more is bc you already are addictedDrugs dont do anything helpful in solving lifes problems   Once the effect wears off the stressful situation is once again waiting for you to address itThink over your reason for not directly asking your psychologist about upping your doseAlso do you ever talk about your life problems with this psychologist or only your need for drugs    The more gradual path to a better life is to not need drugs in the first place This consists of your willingness to face the matters that are creating such terrible feelings inside you
"terrified, dangerous, not happy, more sex",I would suggest possibly talking with a physician about all the different types of protection They may be able to help you to know about all of the options that are availableIt sounds like your partner is open to understanding your concerns Perhaps until you have the chance to speak with someone about the effectiveness of different contraception and forms of protection are either of you open to other forms of engaging in sexual intimacy without penetration but with use of vibrators toys designed for sexual interactions etc
"car accident, totaled car, gave up job, pursue school fulltime, failed class, boyfriend, thinks I'm stupid, break up, nowhere to go, losing everything",When we feel overwhelmed by life situations it is important to understand where the feeling is coming from  Once we understand the source it is important to normalize the situations that got us there and find balance in our livesFirst car accidents are common and since they are accidents they are not a reflection of us   When we have an accident we feel anxious worried and may have some trauma after the accidents  If you have been experiencing anxiety since the car accident talk to your doctor or therapist about it  Second a lot of people fail classes tasks deadlines etc but they dont give up on their goal  We have to remember that failing is part of the learning process and having the courage to try again is what gives us determination and character  Remind yourself what motivated you to leave your job and the courage and determination that took to do so then channel that energy back into school  Third when we have problems in our relationships is helpful to look for ways to improve communication discuss our concerns and how we want to resolve them but it may be that the relationship needs to end if there isnt enough interest in one of the parts or if theres verbal or emotional abuse  Consider talking to your boyfriend and set some boundaries regarding appropriate communicationAt all times  focus on being kind to yourself and improving your selfesteem increase selfcare activities do more things that you enjoy meditate in what gives you peace and make an effort to have more of that in your life   At the end you are the one in control of your life and you determine who you becomeQué puedo hacer cuando siento que mi vida está fuera de controlEstuve en un accidente de auto y fue pérdida total  Deje mi trabajo de 9 años para completar un grado a tiempo completo  Falle una clase y mi novio piensa que soy estúpida el quiere dejarme  No tengo a donde ir y siento que lo estoy perdiendo todoCuando nos sentimos agobiados es importante reconocer donde estamos parados y entender de donde vienen esas emociones  Ya que entendemos la fuente de agobio es importante normalizar las situaciones que lo causaron y volver a encontrar el balance en nuestra vidaPrimero los accidentes de auto son comunes y por ser accidentes no son un reflejo de nosotros o nuestras destrezas  Cuando experimentamos accidentes no s sentimos ansiosos preocupados y puede que experimentemos algún trauma  Si sientes ansiedad extrema preocupación habla con tu doctor o terapista al respecto  Segundo muchas personas fallan clases tareas fechas de entrega pero no se rinden  Tenemos que recordar que fallar es parte del proceso de aprendizaje y tener el valor de intentarlo de nuevo es lo que nos da determinación y carácter   Recuerda que te impulsó a dejar tu trabajo y canaliza esa energía en la escuela  Tercero  cuando tenemos problemas en las relaciones es importante comunicar nuestras preocupaciones y diferencias pero puede ser que la relación termine si no hay interés mutuo o si hay algún tipo de abuso   Considera hablar con tu novio y establecer límites respecto a la comunicación apropiadaEn todo momento enfócate en cuidarte a ti misma y mejorar tu autoestima aumenta las actividades que te ayudan a sentirte bien medita sobre lo que te paz y pasa más tiempo practicando esas actividades
"scared, night time, sleeping alone",Being able to know you feel anxiety and write about it is the first step to addressing and handling itGenerally anxiety is deep fear of not being able to handle what comes up in life  Somehow the person was insufficiently nurtured and so felt  insecure when very youngUsually the person had to fend on at least a psychological and emotional level for themselves before reaching an age when doing so would have been reasonableTheir inner feeling of overwhelmed from when very young hasnt faced the reality that the grown person is now capable even if this takes some practice Try asking yourself what you are afraid of and theorize how you would handle these situations as a grown personAlso sometimes anxiety comes from feeling lonely  This loneliness is reminiscent of the loneliness that the grown person now felt when being left to take care of situations as a child which were too difficult and complex for any child to address
"track and softball team, small school, obligated, horrible runner, dad wants me, track meet, sick, cry",Does anyone notice that you get sick and cry on track meet daysHave you told anyoneFrom what you write as much as you would like to please your school and dad something within you doesnt quite want to fully follow throughStep one in life always is to know what you want and what your limits are   It already is difficult to avoid listening to your bodyTry understanding what is difficult in telling your father that youd like doing as he wishes only are not able to do so because you are emotionally and physically distraught on the days you have trackAfter finishing the season for this year with your schools track team then expect to concentrate on taking care of your own need to not do trackHopefully your father will understand and care about your problem   If he does not and track is more important than your well being then you have a different problem entirely
"socially awkward, want to be popular, scared, nice, fear, work up courage, lose fear",Change can be uncomfortable but sometimes those uncomfortable moments are the opportunity for us to be the person we feel we really are  It sounds like you like to spend the time in your head anticipating the worst why not be in the present and encourage yourself that you can talk to people and it will be okay  By telling yourself it will not be okay or that it will go wrong you are hurting your confidence to do what you want  Give yourself some credit for being awesome and tell yourself you can build new friendshipsit may be the motivation you need to move past this fear
"feeling of being watched, hidden video cameras, feeling exposed, reading my thoughts, things meant for me, people talking about me, whispering about me",It sounds like you are feeling pretty overwhelmed with worry about being continuously monitored with no privacy even in your own mind and as if people are constantly saying things about you in whispers on in the media Its hard to say from a post online what is at the root of this experience but you may be able to get insight into that as well as develop ways of coping with the distress of feeling this way with the help of a good therapist There is no pill or technique that can guarantee that this experience will go away though it might however there are things that you can do so that you can understand it better and so that it does not have such an impact on your ability to lead a satisfy life
"bad habit, thinking, worrying, what others may think, want to stop, enjoy things",Thinking about what others think of us is a natural tendency Human beings are social creatures and rely on feedback from the outside world of people places and things to let us know more about ourselves We also have an inner voice dialogue conscience etc that helps us to determine the path for us Often when someone is worried about the external feedback and focuses on this as the sole source of information it can create a dependency that can become problematic Balance is key to so many things in life Your own voice is powerful and has strength to provide you the enjoyment you seek Dont discount it and rely only on the voices of others
"uncomfortable, social anxiety, not want to talk, answer questions, get over",you can learn lots of skillstechniques to feel more confident in what you need to do that will decrease your anxious response for sure  And  you can also learn how to work with your personality that may not like the attention You may find that talking to others through the internet is more comfortable and you are great at it or that you love one on one talking but arent really made for group talking There is a place in this world for you either way Public speaking skills can be practiced in speech class or toastmaster group they will give you practice in a safe environment where the cool kids or cutest boy arent ready to laugh at you  What topics are you interested in and what groups can you do a little speaking up Maybe in your small group at church try and raise you hand to share your opinion or maybe your Girl Scout troop Look around for a peer and one adult who you like to hear speak out ask them to share with you 2 things that help them feel comfortable speaking in public Check out some Ted Talks and see how they share in groups Social anxiety is a difficult concern and picking apart what is your awesome personality and what needs skill building and mindfulnessanxiety  help are important steps Good luck
"nightmares, being killed, wake up in a panic, crying, sweating, terrified, falling asleep, affecting daily life, make nightmares stop",Hello and thank you for your question Sleep problems including insomnia and even the nightmares that you are writing about are really common for people and so many people suffer from them Here are a few things to consider or to try 1 Have you changed or started taking any new medication lately Medications can certainly affect your sleep and some can even cause vivid or frightening dreams If you are taking a new medication talk to your provider about the nightmares this may be the cause 2 Stress can certainly increase our difficulty with sleep and can also begin to affect our dream states The dreams may not make much sense but then again even good dreams dont always make much sense Ask yourself do I have any new or renewed stressors in my life Work school relationships health all of these areas and many more are places where stress can hide out If this is the case talk with your provider or consider seeing a counselor who may be able to help 3 Something to consider is that once we start to have anxiety or stress about something we can begin to obsess about it My guess is that going to bed for sleep is no longer a pleasant thing for you Your stress and fear of what may happen when you sleep could start way before you actually go to bed This could increase your chances of having another bad dream Try relaxation techniques before going to bed If you have YouTube you can pull up Guided Meditation for Sleep exercises to help you relax There are many different ones to choose from You may also want to try deep breathing4 There are selfhelp ideas for managing bad nightmares If you Google search Nightmare Rescripting or Nightmare Exposure you may find some ideas and instructions on how to manage dreams I hope these ideas help Be well Robin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC
"paranoid, someone else, hiding something",Have you spoken to him about your fears Perhaps you can explain this feeling to him and let him know what might lead to feeling more secure  Also it is important to trust your intuition  Perhaps there are good reasons to feel concerned It may not be paranoia  it may be based in reality
"concerned, anxiety, feeling, hurt, interested, BDSM intercourse, tried, always wants","Hello Thank you for your question There are few things
that people find more personal than their sexual relationships When we feel
connected to our partner sex can be best thing since sliced bread However if
we feel disconnected in some way sex can feel degrading and even painful 
I dont know the specifics about your relationship or how
comfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend but this is one of those
situations where communicating your fears is a good idea The only exception to
that would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way If you
believe that then you should do whatever you think is safe It sounds like
there is a part of you that is already afraid of him and if that is the case
then remaining safe is your top priority 
Assuming you are able to share with him your feelings
telling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate
and sexually healthy Sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable for
all parties All parties should feel respected and able to say no to
absolutely anything they are not comfortable with 
I call the respectful agreement between sexual partners sex
trust Sex Trust means your partner respects your boundaries It means they
wont degrade you sexually with hurtful words forced sex or forcing or
coercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having  Your personal safety and mental wellbeing is
what is most important 
Now if there is a part of you that is curious about BDSM
and may be interested in participating in it there are many websites that you
can explore to learn information I will warn you some websites and articles
are better or worse than others but you may at least feel more informed 
Many people engage in BDSM and have happy relationships but
again it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants It is
also important to know that BDSM is not just one thing and people practice it
differently based on comfort If it is something you are uncomfortable with
then you shouldnt feel obligated to do it
 
I hope this was helpful Be well

"anxiety, scared, outcomes, cant do anything by myself",This is a very common question in my practice Panic attacks typically emerge from an underlying issue ex Depression low selfesteem fears To decrease your anxiety symptoms its recommended to seek treatment with a therapist who specializes in working with anxiety disorders and most importantly one with whom you feel comfortable withIn my practice I educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety1 Starting a daily mindfulness practice For example listening to guided meditation engaging in deep breathing exercises yoga practice or other positive calming activities2 Understand your negative and positive thoughts Many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen Increase positive selftalk when feeling down or when anxious For example I dont need to worry I am calm and relaxed 3 Exposure to fearful or anxious situations This can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional Many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure This may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do For example leaving the house presenting in front of others going to social events and having conversations with people However the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills ex deep breathing the chances of anxiety will decrease I hope this was helpful Keep in mind a therapist can help with guiding you through self relaxation and improvement
"communication issue, upset, dating, married, cousin, sister, uncle, aunt, fiancé, wife",Based on the information provided this is an issue with boundaries   Sounds like your uncle goes to your mom and possibly your mother takes the issues to you  I do not like to assume so I will direct you to information regarding families dealing with enmeshment and triangulation  Enmeshment is the concept of diffused boundaries in families and other personal relationships  Triangulation is two individuals relaying information to a third party what cannot be said directly to each other  From someone who has dealt with both these issues on a personal level being informed about family dynamics is beneficial and can help you develop healthy boundaries for yourself within your family structure  You may need assistance with developing healthy boundaries  Although it is possible it is not easy to change the way you have been operating for any extended amount of time  Hope this help
"freak out, lightheaded, sweaty, trouble breathing, public speaking, big crowds","Basically your response is the fight flight or freeze reaction
which is hard wired into the human nervous system specifically the autonomic nervous system called the autonomic response  This system
is responsible for regulating the heart digestion respiratory rate
as well as other aspects which match the symptoms you describe  It is largely an unconscious function but
with training it can be managed such as a public speaking course in which you
prepare and even have some exposure to smaller experiences to help you prepare
and cope for larger presentations  One of the greatest applications of
addressing this response is the NASA program which exposes the astronauts to situations
they will encounter while in space which will trigger the response so that when
it does happen not if but when that they are able to move through the
challenge with success  You can learn
more about his by going to TED Talks What I learned about going blind in space It is
a truly inspiring look at what you are experiencing as well as how to deal with
it 
With that being said finding a program
like a Dale Carnegie Public Speaking program can help  Working with a counselor who can help you
utilize visualization of an upcoming speech has been shown to help and you can
always talk to your doctor to see what options might be available there as
well Good luck"
"teenage girl, seeing the same dream, very young, panic, cry, remember, what should I do",There is no scientifically established formula for understanding dreams that I know about however many people get a great deal of value from exploring what their dreams mean It is believed by many that our dreams contain metaphors that represent meaningful patterns in our lives and relationships and if we pay attention to them we can learn important things about ourselves One thing you might try to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things is to take note of whatever you do remember any details about your experience such as when do you wake up from the dream how do you feel both emotionally and physically what are you thinking about when you wake up is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream If you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up People seem to have more difficulty remembering dreams the more time they let go by before attempting to record the dream or if you go back to sleep before recording what you remember
"love, hurts, apart, feel, last",I would suggest that you look up the word codependency and its characteristics  See if you relate to those characteristics  I have a feeling  you have suffered some form of loss in your life that you have not dealt with properly  For some reason you are depending on your boyfriend to fill that loss  Considering working with a counseling to work through your emotions and resolve any lingering issues
"low self-esteem thoughts, thinking, hanging with ex-girlfriend, loss for words, stuck in own thoughts, nervous, butterflies",Sounds like you are struggling with your own negative thoughts  As you stated everything was great then you started having low selfesteem thoughts and thinking  What is contributing to these negative thoughts  His actions or your past experiences with unhealthy relationships would be my question
"friend since I was 19, dont go anywhere, no job, afraid of people",Individual andor group therapy can be a powerful antidote for social anxiety Often in therapy the things that tend to get in the way of our securing satisfying and lasting personal relationships will appear in some way in the therapy relationship and a competent therapist will be able to help you work through this anxiety in a sensitive way and eventually encourage you to seek out the personal relationships that you want In group therapy you have an opportunity to have a relationship not only with the therapist but several other people who are all in the group in order to give and receive mutual support to one another
"insecure, repressed stress, drinking problem, on edge, oddly emotional, paranoid, jumpy",Given the description you have posted here it may be time to find someone to work with  First and foremost look into working with someone who specializes in working with individuals with challenges surrounding drinking This would need to be assessed first since if it has been ongoing it may be making the situation worse and given the time it has been utilized as a coping mechanism there is reason to believe that the structure of your brain may have been effected as has been demonstrated by current neurological research  There are however ways to address this  As for coping mechanisms the person you work with should also look at offering you alternatives such as the skills found within the Dialectic Behavior Therapy model DBT which has several useful tools to help address the underlying anxiety and difficulty managing emotional regulation  Mindfulness another component of DBT should also prove to be useful in both becoming aware of your state of mind and emotional state to allow you to make different choices which has been supported by a growing body of evidence  There are also other tools designed to help repair damaged relationships  Well worth looking intoSeeking help is never easy and it is only human to be hesitant given some of the cultural views of working with therapist  This is a difficult place to be in and one that is not easy to move out of but sitting on it is not going to help it go away  Think of it this way if you broke your arm would you just wrap it up and hope for the best or seek out a professional to help you set the break and teach you how to mend the wound  The same applies here  Think of it as first aid for the mind
"annoying, bothersome, fine, stressing, everyone else out",I think you have identified something important here Its not unusual to experience feelings that dont seem to match up with what your rational mind recognizes In this case it sounds like a part of you recognizes that the people around you do not find you annoying and bothersome Despite knowing that people like you it seems that theres still a part of you that feels like youre a botherFinding a local counselor who can work with you to process those feelings might be just the help you need
"paranoid, mind, best of me, break in, think a lot, paranoia, loud noises, cars going by, grocery store, noisy, people looking at me",Paranoid people dont realize they are paranoid  They believe their actions to be reasonable responses to potential threatsFrom what you write you are aware that your actions may be understood as extremeInstead of trying to fit your behavior into a negative psychological category try seeing each of the behaviors you list here as your own uniquenessThis way you will become more tolerant of what very well be your natural tendenciesIf you are someone who needs a lot of time in quiet then not liking loud noises doesnt make you paranoid it is simply the way of who you areOne possible way of feeling better is if you would accept the answers youve developed so far for yourself  They may be a little unusual compared to what we consider mainstream  From what you describe you already are dealing with what you call paranoia
"judging, overwhelmed, deep hole of thoughts, school dances, completely alone, people judging",It sounds like a couple of things are going on here you are noticing yourself feeling judged by the people around you and that you are avoiding social activities and in addition to this you have intrusive thoughts that you are being judged even when alone It sounds like these thoughts are pretty distressing and you are wondering what is happening to you Many people who come to therapy experience intrusive and distressing thoughts of various kinds which often influence their behavior in ways that they may not like such as leading them to isolate In therapy you may be able to gain insight into the nature of your distress as well as learn ways to cope and eventually alleviate this distress so that you can have satisfaction and security in your life and relationships
"close call, blood clot, internal bleeding, blood transfusions, medical treatment, anxiety, consuming, terrified, raise, protect",Hi Meriden its natural that after a serious scare like that you would have some anxiety and fear This fear is helpful to some extent because it will assist you in taking care of yourself and not taking unnecessary risks with your health You can say thanks very much to fear for trying to protect you and then you can take steps to reduce it Right now fear is working overtime and stealing your quality of life You can work to put it into perspectiveI invite you to imagine that your job is to convince fear that you dont need it screaming in your ear constantly in order to be as safe as you can be Imagine that fear is in front of you Its saying hey you need me If I wasnt keeping you alert you would be very ill Fear doesnt trust you to take care of yourself What is the evidence you are caring for yourself and doing everything you can to prevent a recurrence What is the evidence that this wont likely happen again it was specifically connected to the stress of labour right What is the evidence from your doctor that this is unlikely to recur What is the evidence that you are healing What is the evidence that you are very aware of the danger and will respond quickly if there is a recurrence What is the evidence that worrying about it will hurt you not help you How many hours of your life do you want to hand over to fearFear is trying to keep you safe but you can turn the volume down by talking to yourself about all these things I wish you well
"urge to throw away, constantly on my mind, anxious, not sleeping, thinking, get rid of, don't know why, started years ago, lived with dad, moved in with mom, started again",Since you wrote that you noticed a change in your throwing away urge when you changed with which parent you lived would you feel that throwing away things is connected to wanting to be done with certain areas of influence with either parentPlay in your mind with the metaphor of throwing away and whatever associations you feel toward this  Are you feeling alarmed or freed by throwing away things  Im only suggesting these not telling you that they apply necessarilyAnxiety comes up when people feel helpless to manage a meaningful part of their lives  So pay attention whether your stuff represents difficult scenarios or phases of your growing up years   Possibly you are trying to rid yourself of painful feelings which were part of your early years relationship with either parentBasically sounds as though you are trying to establish a clearer sense of who you are and the throwing away part is a means of discovering who you are once all the clutter is released
"love, thinking, cry, obsessive, magic, amazing, mistaken",Keller it sounds like youre living this relationship in your mind instead of in the real world You can get answers to your questions by talking to himgetting to know him will answer all the curiosities you have Youre asking the questions in your head instead of being in the friendship So what is it that gets in the way of actually asking the questions and getting to know him Fear of rejection Fear of something else If you have fear that keeps you from having fulfilling friendships I recommend a therapist to help you work through that I wish you well
"anxiety, panic attacks, obsessive-compulsive disorder, questioning everything, relationship issues, discomfort, uncertainty",How is your boyfriend responding to your discomfort around himHas he told you that hes noticed changes in youThe good news about a relationship is that you can talk about matters with the other person  Doing so can only help clarify feelings and what either of you expect from the relationship  Given that the two of you recently moved in together it is natural for new dynamics feelings and expectations to arise  It just adds to the reasonableness of talking with each other about how living together feels to each of youPsychiatrists earn their living by diagnosing people and telling them to take pills  Very often just being told the person has a condition makes them feel fragile and less capable than they actually areAnxiety and panic attacks do mean that there is a great deal of emotion and situation needing to be addressedIt is the normal sign of having to address many or deep matters   Be patient and give yourself time to learn the details of your relationship and whatever the career particulars are that are bothering you   Youre apparently selfaware since youre the one describing your own problematic situations  Keep the label of being disordered aside  Psychiatry labels do more good for psychiatrists than they do for people who are trying to live their lives
"toddler defies, authoritative, says no, feel in control",Hi BiddefordThis is a super goal Feeling powerless is something parents are wise to get used to theres a creature in the home whose job it is to find and use their power in the family and in the world Of course your toddler defies you and thats healthy I worry more about the overly compliant ones She is wanting to know what the rules are and all you have to do is show her clearly where the lines are Ill give you some tipsFirst remind yourself that its her job to learn what the rules are and where her power is Dont be so surprised when she wants it her way If we go through our days being ready and prepared for these beautiful creatures to have minds of their own were less caught off guard when it happens Avoid situations that invite power struggles Any time you tell your daughter do this now you set up a power struggle The good thing is that shes young enough you can pick her up now is the time to teach her that moms or dads word means something So if you say lets get you dressed then be prepared to pick her up right away and show her that when you say something will happen you can make it happen And Im talking about gently picking her up herenot roughly Pick your battles only give instructions when you have the power to make it happenGive her choices so she can see her power Instead of opening her drawer and asking what she wants to wear give her two choices Heres an exampleshes on the ipad and you say ipad time is over She says no You can say ipad time is over If you put it down you can play later If I have to take it away you dont play it later The choice is hers Then follow throughWhenthen statements are really helpful Your child asks for something Instead of saying no try as soon as the toys are picked up we can have a snack Youre simply a pleasant parent who wants the same thing they dobut they have to earn it Staying calm yourself is the key because then at least you will feel in control of yourself which is the ultimate goal Use selftalk to calm yourself Remind yourself her behaviour is normal and healthy Breathe through a moment in which you would have reacted and it will be over by the time the breath is done You can give yourself time to think before you make parenting decisions Time is a useful tool not enough parents use Good luck

"anxiety, self-loathing, young adult, virgin girl, boyfriend, first kiss, worry, waiting forever, lose virginity, first boyfriend, bad temptations, hooking up, oral sex, dirty, pressured, surprised, good looking, tall, sports, excellent grades, university, approached, date, family relationships, single forever",Hi Winters Im so glad you wrote because I think there are a lot of young women experiencing the exact same thing You feel selfloathing for both being a virgin and for being sexually active Young women have always gotten crazy mixed messages about what theyre supposed to be They feel pressure to be pure and they also feel pressure to be the vixen and please men sexually But you cant be both so you cant ever win if you buy into all that horse manure excuse my language This current hookup culture puts added pressure on girls to expect nothing more than random sexual encounters that leave you feeling empty and used perhaps desirable in that moment but mostly worthless The stupid part is that research tells us that young men are also impacted negatively by this cultural norm that values sex and not relationship they feel guilt and loneliness  I urge you to talk to other girls and women about your feelings My hope and prayer is that they will echo my words hereYour value and power cannot ever be found in whether a man wants you whether you turn his eye or how he treats you Your sexuality is a beautiful part of who you are and it is to be celebrated I love that you want to celebrate it with someone who cares Who you are is so very much more than your sexuality You sound like you have a lot of things going for you Try to see all of those things when you think of yourselfThere are many more virgins out there and many are afraid like you that they dont fit in We are all different and you dont have to be anything but who you want to be who you are You dont have to have any kind of sex until youre ready and that makes you brave and smart not weirdYoure tall and beautiful and guys may be intimidated by that It may take time for you to meet the right guy but hes out there The question is How do you want to spend your time until he crosses your path I hope you talk to someone soon and find out that your feelings are normal I wish you the best
"unconfident, insecure, self-questioning, quiet, scared, anxiety, doomed, hard, depression, brings me down, need to create a better life, change",One of the greatest ways that we can promote ourselves s by learning how to assert ourselves  Despite what most people think of when they hear the word assertive assertive communication is one of the best ways to manage interpersonal conflict as well as maintain personal boundaries  Once we become comfortable with acknowledging our boundaries there is usually a followup whereby we realize that we have the right to those boundaries  In effect assertiveness communication becomes its own selfmotivating force in managing positive selfesteem You may want to invest in a workbook that can help you to develop these skills on your own or work directly with a therapist to develop them in a safe situation   One of the Workbooks that I have found to be very helpful is The Assertiveness Workbook How to Express your Ideas and Stand Up for Yourself at Work and in Relationships by Randy J Paterson
"trouble sleeping, sleep too much, tired, increased irritability, anxiety attacks, something wrong, what should I do",Hi there I have to commend you on reaching out to get some answers on why you are feeling the way that you are feeling A lot of people secretly go about their lives every day feeling this way because they are too afraid of what the answer might beFirst off what stressors do you have in your life right now Financial relationship and unemployment are all common stressors for people They can often make it difficult for us to sleep at night due to the constant racing thoughts and wonders of how you will deal with it all Secondly do you have a history of depression or does depression run in your family Some of the symptoms listed here in this question ie trouble sleeping constant fatigue too much sleep anger  anxiety are all common symptoms of depression Often times these symptoms can be overlooked and mistaken for just being tired Furthermore its important to ask yourself if you are feeling worthless problems with concentration and recurrent thoughts of death If you are having these symptoms please seek help IMMEDIATELY Lastly considering your stated symptoms I would recommend reaching out to your Doctor for further consult Its always better to be safe and the earlier you catch the symptoms the faster you will get to feeling better do Some helpful tips for the your Doctor would be to monitor your sleep habits ie how much or little are you sleeping make a list of your triggers for your anger outbursts as well as your triggers for your anxiety attacks I hope this was helpful and the best of luck to you

"feel terrible, hole in my stomach, hurt myself",Hi Kansas I feel strongly that the help of a professional therapist is important here Feelings are never wrong but it can help to understand where they come from and talk to someone who can teach you healthy ways to cope Selfharm is not the answer to managing those emotions you feel in your stomach Although Im glad you said something here a professional would need to spend some time with you and get a deep understanding of your life in order to help you sort all these reactions out effectively I hope you reach out to someone soon
"rape, repeated, younger, parents, action taken, adult, suffer, extreme anxiety",While anxiety can come about for many reasons trauma is definitely one of the factors that makes anxiety a possibility both immediately following a traumatic event and later in life When we have experienced such scary violations of our bodies  we may experience residual effects of fear for many years to come This is normal natural and in many ways helpful  at least initially This fear is in some way a sign that your bodymind is taking good care of you  trying to keep you on your toes in order to protect you from anything terrible happening to you again However as it sounds like you know anxiety feels awful and there are certainly ways of learning to reduce anxiety In order to get the tools you need to manage anxiety and also understand where it comes from and how it works in your life I would encourage you to seek professional help and check out anxiety resources online
"outgoing, not knowing what to say, self-conscious, cold shoulder, not wanting to talk",Would you feel more secure in conversations if instead of talking soon after meeting someone or entering a social situation you simply listened attentively to the other peopleThis way youd have a more secure idea of what topics the group likes talking about and whether you like talking about these topics as wellMaybe you simply are in groups or situations in which you dont care for the people or focusStart by trusting your own evaluation of your true interest in being among the groups in which you areMaybe you simply need new and different groups
"preventing from getting a job, bad relationship with bipolar mother, living with mother, stresses me out, locked myself in room, no friends, no family, no money for therapy, need therapy, secure a job",Overwhelming fear social anxiety and depression are especially painful because they make behaving constructively a challenge  But there are also lots of examples of folks who have successfully worked their way through this  So there is hope   In addition to the suggestion to visit your doctor who may prescribe a medication to help you relax there are many social service agencies who provide free counseling or take medicaid  A good CBT therapist will help you look at your thinking so that you may see how you are distorting your thoughts  Behavior is also important  Despite how you may feel it is helpful to go out to do things that relax you maybe a yoga class or a meditation class  Exercise Diet Eat well Think back on the things that you used to do that helped in the past and force yourself to do these things again  I know that this seems hard but it beats the alternative doesnt it  Of course I recommend you pick up a copy of my book Living Yes which will help you look at these and other ideas to help you out  I hope you get unstuck soon  Mark wwwMarkMorrisLCSWcom and wwwLivingYesorg
"feel like, time is going too fast",Thank you for reaching out That is a great question As an American I can truly say that I spend way too much time on the go It is a proven fact that Americans live in a fast paced environment compared to Europe I often ask myself what if I only had one day left on this Earth What would I do Well that is an easy question I would spend it with my family Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World right Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bringTime management is a very important factor when learning to live life to the fullest In fact this is a required course in undergraduate college now Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this Personally for myself I like to keep a calendar with a todo list I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list That way if I do not get through the list I am not stressing over the little things When planning your day it is important you schedule work eat and play A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work it must be done There is discipline involved in this process If you have trouble with this then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spousepartner reminding you that this is a time for play and not workThese are just some ideas that I am throwing out there Again everyone has their own style on time management I hope this was helpful for you Please dont hesitate to reach out for anything further
"anxieties, shut down, pressured, unable to speak, body image issues, self-confidence issues, invalidated, paranoid, guilty, worthless",Im sorry to hear that you are unable to get through to your parents It sounds like you are experiencing a great deal of anxiety that needs to be addressed by a professional despite the fact that you are unable to at the moment I would recommend talking with another adult such as a school counselor that can offer you support in this area Perhaps they can work with you on your anxiety issues and schedule a meeting with your parents so that heshe may help mediate the conversation with themIf you are unable to reach out to a school counselor maybe you can try a member of the family such as an aunt or an uncle that feels comfortable addressing the issue with your parents Sometimes it helps hearing it from a third party before the situations is taken seriously enoughGood luck
"panic attacks, medications, control, anxious, moving in",Im sorry to hear that you are currently experiencing panic attacks I hope that the medication you have been prescribed has provided you with some relief Unfortunately I dont feel that moving in with your girlfriend would alleviate your anxiety Although you may feel very anxious about leaving her your body is reacting to this stressful event in your life in an unhealthy manner You may be able to render this particular situation but its likely that you may experience another panic attack when an additional stressful event arises Therefore it is essential that you address the reason for why you are experiencing panic attacks in the first place followed by practicing coping mechanisms in the case that one would arise in the futureTalk therapy has shown to be effective with those affected by anxiety along with breathing exercises and yoga A trained therapist will be able to assist you in finding the right stress reducing method so that you can reduce the chance of another attack occurringI wish you the best of luck It sounds like you are very happy in your relationship and I hope you are able to reduce your anxiety so that you are able to enjoy one another
"head injury, mind races, trouble sleeping, anxiety, medicine rejection, stomach sickness, mouth blisters, calm down, wreck",You didnt say what or how many medications youve tried Certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous but I havent heard of any that cause mouth blisters so there may be some other underlying medical issue there I would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if youve suffered a severe head injury There are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effectsBut beyond that have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation Meditation can be very effective but it takes practice and you dont have to sit crosslegged for hours chanting Ohm to meditate Its about focusing on your breath rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head And when they do take your mind off your breath simply refocus and refocus and refocus Like I said it takes practice so dont give up You can find many sites offering different ways to meditate so look around and see what works best for you Like medication you just have to find the one that works best and that might take some experimentationI hope this helps and best of luck to you
"stressed, crying, freaking out, bright student, afraid, stressing too much, break her, not normal, doctor",Watching children go through challenges in their lives is difficult On a very basic level There exists a primal need to protect them from harm The hard part for parents is letting them feel those challenges and working through them as they get older At some point there is a moment that occurs when the role as a parent shifts Children no longer need the basics food shelter water safety as much as when they were toddlers but rather their needs shift to wanting more support encouragement advice and room to make mistakes This is where the ability to communicate with them letting them direct the sails to gather the wind needed to move is so important Keep the lines of communication open and be available to give feedback when they ask for it
"children, cannot afford, pay for, last year, two weeks, by herself",I imagine you are trying to figure out a way to be fair to your adult kids  The key word is adult  If your daughter can afford to join the family for a vacation thats great shes welcome to come  However as you pointed out she took a vacation by herself last year  she chose to put her resources time off work and money into doing that  Good for her  she did what she wanted  If she wants to budget time and money for a family vacation she willAs for feeling guilty let me echo the sentiments already offered  vacations are lovely but not a survival need  Your girl is in her 20s and its her turn to provide for herself  You did your parenting  now go enjoy your vacation with whoever can and wants to join you
"verbally abused, trapped, no escape, horrible things, emotionally drained, cope, deal with",All you can docontrol is work on yourself When you have enough sense of self you will know how to deal with your family Therapy is an investment in yourself which affects your family
"fussing, dodging being hit, sorry, no marks, paranoid, right to be",This sounds frightening and overwhelming and Im glad you are reaching out for help I cant say for sure your children are being abused but I can understand your  suspicion since there appears to be a change your childrens behavior I think it would be important for you to keep an eye on the situation Incase you notice any other changes If you become more concerned even  suspicions of child abuse are reportable to  Family protective services If they feel it is necessary they can do an  investigation You are doing the biggest thing for your children by being there for them and supporting them
"angry, afraid, okay, emotions, symptoms, situations",The short answer to your question is No its not okay for anyone to ever be doing this Theres a lot of unanswered questions and other factors going on here that need attention Nevertheless dont hesitate to seek out legal counsel andor call 911    Ideally your fiancé would be able to speak directly to her exhusband and set reasonable boundaries that honor whatever legal agreements are in force resultant from the divorce and custody agreements The fact that shes afraid to say anything to him about his inappropriate behavior and that she hasnt been able to give you any reason for her fear suggests possible factors of past abusive behaviors entitlement andor codependence   I hope things work out well for all and Im confident a skilled therapist could help all navigate how best to set boundaries and experience greater healing
"daughter in later elementary school, cant color in the lines, words jumble together, writes, big spaces, skips lines",Depending on your daughters age this could be a learning disability  I suggest contacting the school counselor and asking for an evaluation once she is evaluated and depending on the diagnosis she could be provided with treatment recommendations like occupational therapy reading glasses or assistance in class These and more accommodations are enforced under the 504 act Consider if the observations that you have done are affecting her performance in school only or also in other settings  Observe her behavior and or her emotions and see if they change as well  Discuss these with your daughters counselor as wellTiene mi hija un desorden mentalMi hija está en la escuela elemental  Ella no puede colorear dentro de la línea  Mezcla las palabras cuando escribe a menos que tenga grandes espacios o brinca las líneasDependiendo de la edad de tu hija esto puede ser un problema de aprendizaje  Te sugiero que contactes al consejero escolar y solicites una evaluación dependiendo de la diagnosis ellos pueden recomendar tratamientos como terapia ocupacional lentes para leer o asistencia en clase   Estos acomodos son provistos bajo la acta 504  Considera si las observaciones que has hecho afectan el desempeño de tu hija en la escuela o en otras áreas también observa su conducta y emociones y repórtaselo al consejero escolar
"normal rate, act younger, play with younger kids, doesnt act her age, happening, normal",This is certainly an important issue to look into It is always helpful to speak with the childs pediatrician since they are most familiar with the childs developmental history Also children tend to regress behaviorally when facing events and interactions they feel to have no control over this can be as simple as a loss of a pet a recent move death in the family  andor as serious as sexual abuse and other things If you have not spoken to the school that can be a good starting point
"exwife married, used me, have a child, uses that child as a pawn, misses me, move on, live in the past, see my child, as much as possible, very little, confusing for the child",You can move on and not live in the past in the context of your exrelationship but that does not mean moving on from your child Moving on then would involve accepting the end of the relationship and developing a civil relationship with your expartner as far as is possible for the sake of your childs developmentGenerally its good for a functional nonabusive parent to spend time with hisher child but only insofar as that doesnt cause your child unnecessary stress That requires the two adults to act like adults with each other for the sake of their childWhats confusing for children is seeing their parents act uncivilly or manipulatively Children also do well with routines so regular dependable visitation is preferable to random visitation or worse not following through on commitmentsBut if one person is exploiting their child to harm their expartner then visiting your child in that context may be stressful to himher depending on what you mean by using your child as a pawn When dealing with a hostile expartner your first challenge is to negotiate rules and boundaries with your expartner about appropriate behavior for the good of your child If you cannot come to an agreement a counselor can help mediate a conversation If thats not an option then it may be possible to turn to family court to stipulate visitation rules for which youd have to consult with an attorney
"severe autism, entertained, acting up, focus, calm voice, unfair",Behavioral interaction with someone who has severe autism requires highly specialized training both for any professional staff involved with the person and for the family membersIt is an unfair situation for both the person who has autism as well as the campers who do not to expect both sides to get along harmoniouslyIn order to achieve this the campers would need specialized training to know how to respond to distress in the camper who has autismThis would obviously stretch and burden the summer camp budget as well as provide an activity which usually isnt part of summer camp for childrenWhat you can do which may be productive in helping the camper who has autism is to point out the interaction difficulty to the summer administratorsUltimately it is their problem to only take campers who are able to reasonably adjust to socializing together and from what you write the administration has overreached whom they consider reasonable camper mates
"disrespectful attitude, issues, refuses help, living with grandparents, quit job, don't know what to do",Probably the best way to be supportive of your son is to tell him what bothers you about the way hes handling himselfIf youd like him to work with your suggestions then before you make critical comments be sure to validate his strong points and to recognize his natural talentsPeople are much more likely to take advice if the person feels the criticism is spoken by someone who respects them and isnt only critical of themOffer your availability to talk with him if you genuinely feel available to speak with him in a nonjudgmental way
"cried, lost trust, feel disgusting, heart stabbed",You felt bad when you lied so you told the truth  I imagine your mom was really shocked and upset  both of those things tell me you are a pretty honest person  Its possible that your mom had a big reaction simply because she has learned that her child from whom she always assumed honesty was capable of being dishonest  Thats not awesome but its not the end of the world  You made a mistake  youll make more of those in your life just try not to make the same ones over and over againIt sounds like you and your mom are close so I can see why it would feel so awful to have her distrust you  Since you are a fundamentally honest person the way back to being trusted is going to be simple but may take a little time  The recipe is easy  say what you are doinggoing to do do only that unless change is necessary in which case you inform others involved and repeat  And cut yourself some slack  Your mom will recover and so will you  Its an important and painful lesson about integrity but once learned it will serve you well
"communication, sleeps constantly, angry, unfocused, messy room, aches, fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, skin problems, not looking after health, not open to suggestions, how to communicate",That sounds awful and is clearly unsustainable  There are some great answers that give some guidance about what might be an underlying condition  If all physical and mental health issues are ruled out its time to take action  Get backup from friends or family members if you need to but let your daughter know you are giving her 30 days notice  She needs to find another place to live within that time  If she wants to stay with you be clear that first she has to go with a potential to return after she has been out for a good chunk of time  Once out she can prove to you and more importantly to herself that she is capable of maintaining her health and her environment  Remember you are going to rule out issues that would make it impossible for her to be successful if she is in good health her staying with you and living this way is actually harming her
"son stole debit card, lied, not first time, dont know what to do, punish, make him do something, tried talking, asking if anything was wrong, grounded him, nothing works, what should I do",A lot depends on the age of your child but given that it was a misused debit card I am going to guess hes a teen  Assuming that there are a couple of important things to keep in mind1  That he lied about the misuse indicates he knows he was in the wrong  Thats a dreadful feeling  getting caught out and an impulsive lie may have popped out of his mouth before he thought it through after all a debit spend is pretty easy to track  2 Once he lied he stuck with the lie    Somewhere along the line even though he knew that you knew he wasnt telling the truth he stuck with his story  And as you said its not the first time he lied  Now it looks like a habit has formedGoing forward when there is a dishonest act of any kind its essential that you set it up so your son can be truthful  Simply put do not ask questions  If you know for certain that he has for example misused your debit card say so  Asking did you invites him to get creative with denial asking why did you implies that with a good enough reason he might not be in hot water with you  Instead say what is  I see this charge on my debit card and realize you used it without my permission  You can only do this if you know for sure it was him but it sounds like you do  If he meets with denial stay calm restate that you are aware this happened  Then deliver consequences that match the transgression he has to return the item if its returnable or find a way to pay you back for the charge as well as any fees incurred in using it  Make it harder to find your card because he isnt that great at curbing the impulse to use it yetAnd most importantly once the consequence is delivered you have to let it go  Continuing to bring it up wont benefit him but it does have the potential to make him more sneaky  Every time he asks respectfully to use it whether you allow him to or not be sure to praise him for asking nicely  Catch him doing it right as often as possibleHang in there  this isnt super unusual behavior but it isnt acceptable so address it but dont let yourself get too wound up about it
"concerned, 12 year old daughter, walking on toes, coloring, writing messy, suddenly, never walked on tiptoes, colored neatly, advice",It is great that you are noticing these changes with your daughter I cant offer advice without knowing much more about your particular situation but some things to think aboutHas something else happen recently that has been stressful upsettingIs your daughter trying to communicate something to you and if so what might that beHave you discussed these recent changes with her Without being too serious or accusatoryThere is so much changing for her and you nowcommunication and connection are crucial I hope you both can talk to a supportive person about all these changes
"children, oldest, middle child, youngest, biological child, great relationship, attachment, rarely want her around, look forward, nap times, normal",This is your experience your feeling and you are wondering if it is normal which means is this common or the rule This question about how you feel about your third child leads me to believe you are dis turbed etymology agitated or stirred up  Feelings are messages from our soul or spirit that something is not right  So though  it might be normal common the rule  to look forward to a one year olds nap time when you have a three year old a nine year old the dis turbance or stirring up in you is important and requires your attention your listening if you will to your higher self
"guilt, trying to work three jobs, being gone a lot, successful, own business, nanny and cleaning help, great opportunity, spend time with kids",You seem to have been a very positive influence in your kids livesThey may have worked so hard because they understood how difficult and tiring your life was as a single momI feel you are seeing your kids lives through the measurement of how much toil was in your life as a single momIn other words what you see your kids overlooking or not appreciating may remind you of your wishes during the many years you raised your kidsIf it helps you and is possible then maybe you could spend more of your own time tougher with your grandkids  This may give some reward for the many years you spent working to support your kids and had no choice in the amount of time you had with your kidsAs far as your kids relationship to their kids it is now their turn to raise them as they wish within ethical boundaries of courseDepending on the topics you and your kids talk about consider to bring up your concern as to whether they feel their kids your grandkids are missing anything due to the limited time they have with the parents
"early 20s, toddler",Well first lets identify what factors are involved in the situation about which you wroteAre you the only decision maker regarding your stepdaughter living with youIs her dad and your partner living under the same roofWould you feel any obligation to consult with your husband about his opinion and his way of handling the situationHave you talked with your stepdaughter about your observation and your reaction to the fact of her not honoring your boundariesConsider too that there will be an effect on the toddler your grandchild if you kick out your daughterIs your daughter financially ready to live on her own and support herself and her childYou certainly have the right to define the terms of what goes on under your roofIt is only fair to everyone that as many variables as possible be consideredThe conclusion may be that it is in everyones best interest for your stepdaughter to move outIf everyone feels respected and a well thought out plan is developed then the least amount of hurt and stress and the most amount of happiness will be possible from this change
"cussing, screaming, feel stupid, compares, negative way, demeans, abuse",Oh my goodness my heart goes out to you  I pray you have other strong and supportive loved ones or friends surrounding you If you are in school please consider speaking with a counselor on site who can help give you some good coping mechanisms as well as other resourcesI believe most therapists would agree that this type of behavior is indicative of emotional AND verbal abuse And quite often the two overlap because someone who is being yelled at and demeaned is also frequently having hisher emotions preyed upon as well Healthy Place offers us some great examples of emotional abuse which certainly fit the criteria of what you describeYelling or swearing Name calling or insults mockingThreats and intimidationIgnoring or excludingIsolatingHumiliatingDenial of the abuse and blaming of the victimAnd abuse survivor and author Kellie Jo Holly offers some other great examples of verbal abuseEmotionally Abusive StatementsYoure so cute when you try to concentrate Look at you trying to thinkI cant believe I love a stupid jerkAw come on cant you take a jokeSexually Abusive StatementsYou should know how to please me by nowI hoped you were less experiencedStop acting like a whoreFinancially Abusive StatementsYou are going to nickel and dime me to deathIn what world does buying that make senseFine You handle your finances Let me know when things go to hellSocietally Abusive StatementsHow dare you spread around our private businessLet me do the talking people listen to menYou took a vow in front of God and everybody and I expect you to honor itThreatening and Intimidating StatementsIf you dont train that dog Im going to rub your nose in its messI will take our kids if you leave meYoure scared This isnt angry You will KNOW when Im ANGRYSpiritually Abusive StatementKeep your stupid beliefs to yourselfGod will find a way to get you back and it aint gonna be prettyI can feel myself being pulled into hell just listening to your nonsenseIts been my personal clinical experience that children who are experiencing the types of things you describe often say they feel misunderstood lonely or scared and dont want to make things worse by standing up for themselves Even if you feel you cant defend yourself outwardly that doesnt mean your fathers awful and toxic behavior is something you should ever internalize ie believe to be true which is why I hope you are surrounding yourself with people who will speak life and positivity back over you  We are ALL worthy of respect love and kindness Dont ever forget thatMy love and light to you honTamara Powell LMHC
"masturbating, caught looking up porn, worried",Your nephews behavior sounds normal and developmentally appropriate  Masturbation is a healthy expression of sexuality  Most families to create some rules about where its ok to masturbate for example stating that it should be done in the privacy of the childs own room  Im wondering if you or another adult in his life have talked to him about his developing sexuality  It seems like that would help him and you handle his increasing maturity
"gentle talking, counting, calm, talking, sending to room, calmer, calisthenics, not working",Theres two things this post relays  one which Im sure youve already looked into  is working with the school to address this problem Sure sometimes kids dont get along but most schools look at bullying seriously and this sounds serious The other though is additional tools to consider to help your daughter If you havent already read Greenes Explosive Child you might give it a shot While its a little preachy many of the tools are wonderful and can help parents navigate tantrums httpswwwamazoncomExplosiveChildUnderstandingFrustratedChronicallydp0062270451 Another tool that can redirect a child thats losing it is a task If her tantrums say involve throwing things maybe shes in charge of throwing all the sticks and acorns off the driveway into the garbage bin Ie Hey Jenny you seem really angry right now lets use all that energy and get some work done Go with her throw with her even  if possible  making a game out of getting the acorns into the bin from a distance I wish you all the best
"emotions, symptoms, no job, behind on bills, trying everything, no results, feeling neglected, giving until it hurts, afraid of failure, struggling in relationship, no communication, no alone time, need support",Financial stability is probably a good place to start your new life projectIf your partner doesnt work or doesnt contribute his money to the household bills then maybe you are eligible  for some type of stipend from the governmentEspecially since you have kids the child welfare service may intervene to help you  Sometimes too a partner who is unwilling to pay for their kids wellbeing may be pressured by child welfare to make regular contributions to you and your kidsIm glad you are thinking of your needs and those of your kids  This is the philosophy which will show you what road to follow so all three of you are in a secure financial place
"overly tired, throwing a fit, wanted to come home, cried, screamed, said she hated her grandma, wanted to kill herself, new baby, contribute to this, approach",You wrote a very full family context w many directions to examineDo you know or can you find out what the grandma and your daughter were doing in the evening of the screaming episodeIs it possible the grandma abuses your daughter or tells her scary stories watches scary movies  These are only suggestions of some problem between grandma and your daughterAlso ask your daughter directly why she wants to kill herself and what killing herself means   Seven year olds dont have a concept of death being a forever condition  Seven year olds dont have a sense of future meaning besides likingdisliking them   Maybe the new baby is a factor  Do you feel this is a factor   Trust your intuition to tell you if your daughter is resentful of your new babyEven if she is I doubt a seven year old has the capacity to connect current unhappiness with the intention of a future action including suicide
"suicide attempts, pregnant, terminally ill, adopted, died, abusive, foster care, long term effects, childhood history",The true answer is no one can really say with certaintyThe variables are the way this child absorbs and adjusts to these significant changes in their life  All anyone can do is guess at this point and theres no good reason to guessThe only general certainty is that the adult whom this child becomes will have had a profound encounter with the biggest types of human losses a child can go throughSome people become great teachers therapists and philosophers who have this background  Some give up on life and hide away from othersThe best anyone could do who knows this child is to offer love bc this is the greatest guarantee to show there are good people on this earth
"punishment, grandsons, stepmother, school, pink Barbie backpack",Parents are to teach discipline to children not punishment   Punishment is another word for wanting to cause hurt  There is a different in discipline and punishment  Punishment could have long term affects on a childs self image and growth  It can lead to others issues such as bullying from peers as well  Whatever your grandson has done there is a much better way of getting him to understand that his actions are not acceptable  Punishment is not one them  Encourage the stepmother to build a positive relationship with him this way he will learn to respect and trust her  His actions would improve  She may need to attend a parenting class for blended families
"emotions, symptoms, situations, control, live with parents, afford, follow rules, trying to control, early 20s, mother, roof, life",Hi   Im sorry you are having such a tough time with this situation  I have worked with a number of young adults in their 20s who have had to move back home after college  or even stay at home through the college years  Bottom line is that either way  it is so difficult when you are trying to discover who you are and what you want your life to be  to have to live at home   I have even heard much older adults clients  say that when they visit their childhood home  they suddenly feel like a kid again   The old dynamics between adults and their parents and siblings can pop right up as if they have gone back in time and are no longer adults I would suggest that you approach your mom and say something like I am hoping we can talk about the best way for us to manage me living here  I really appreciate that you are giving me a place to live until I get on my feet  and I want to be respectful of you and our home  at the same time  though I feel like its important for me to have more independence than when I was younger because I am growing up and trying to learn more about myself and become more autonomous Can we talk about what might be fair rules that we can  both live with  If she is receptive  maybe you can each write a separate list of what you think would be fair and reasonable and then compare lists and try to make compromises and come up with a list of guidleines that feel fair to you both    If this is too hard to do alone  perhaps you and your mom can meet with a therapist a few times who can help you to come  up with some kind of compromise contract   This is not an easy situation  but if you can approach your mom in a calm and mature way and suggest a planned structured discussion that doesnt take place in the heat of the moment  your mom may be impressed by your maturity and even more receptive to working out some rules that you can both live withGood luck Elissa Gross
"feel like shit, worthless, depressed, lose it",If youre actually able to afford to move out and support your own life then this is a reasonable choiceIf youre not in such a position and must continue for a while to live w your dad then emotionally protect yourself from himDoing so is much more difficult than maybe it soundsDo you have privacy in your house and can you spend more time in a selfcreated safe space than around your dadAlso limit the amount of dialogue you have with him so you dont offer him a chance to feel invited to criticize youAre there other people who live in the household w you and dadIf yes then are they similarly called names or are you singled out by him What do the other family members do when they hear your dad calling you namesIs it possible the other family members dont realize how hurt and upset you are by your dads behaviorIf yes then make a project for yourself to tell the other family members that you suffer from your dads name callingIt is possible the other family members will step in and tell your dad to stopNot necessarily that he will stop  Knowing the others support you emotionally and find you credible is helpful on its own
"anger, feeling responsible, fear, making wrong decisions, wanting to live with mom",Yes from what you wrote your dad doesnt accept responsibility for the way he feels and blames you for his feelingsIm glad you recognize hes handling himself less as a grown person and more like a young childI also understand your hurt and frustration that your father handles himself in a way which shows for now that he is unwilling to respect your wishesYour decision is not surprising since most people wouldnt want to live with a parent who shows little interest to respect their kids decisionsIn terms of how to tell him your choice do this in simple and most basic information terms   Ive decided for now to live w momI suggest to not offer reasons to him bc he doesnt seem interested in hearing them   Giving him reasons would likely trigger him to rebut themIf he asks questions answer them as simply as possibleIf and when you feel he is more willing to understand and know you then youd feel more free to have genuine dialogue with himRight now he doesnt seem very ready to handle this
"overdosed, blames, scared, drug addictions, stroke, depend on",Blaming others is one of our greatest coping mechanisms  It is not just for addiction and often we blame the ones closest to us  You can not stop them from blaming you you can stop yourself for taking on the burden  We are all in charge of the choices we make  No one makes us do something other than our self  We choose how we internalize and react to situations  I would find a good therapist who understands family dynamics and addiction to help you cope with your current environment and help you move forward
"refuses to talk, remembering things from the past, blames me, hates me, should just let, live with her dad, fix things, see her every other weekend",Sorry to hear about your high degree of stressHow old is your daughterWho abused yours daughterThe answers make a difference to your decisionObviously if the father was the abuser then unless your ex demonstrates to you and you believe he will not abuse her your daughter should stay with youIf someone other than the father was the abuser and the father has a good relationship with your daughter then it is possible that the time away from your household will give each of you time away from arguing with one anotherWhat does your daughter tell you she wantsHer wishes must be considered tooRelationships can be fixed   Sometimes being apart helps this process because the two people each have time to reflect more deeply on what they value about the other
"anger, frustration, living situation, disrespectful, sexual curiosity",Youre her mom and she needs you  I would suggest focusing on connection  Since you are not currently living together one way to do this would be to plan a date in which she gets to decide what you do together  Give her time to think about what she wants to do  As long as the activity is safe and affordable try to do it even if its not your thing  While you are with her turn off the phone and give her your undivided attention  The goal would be just for you to enjoy each other and connect
"crying, daddy dies, never see him again, make her daddy die",Children often have a difficult time expressing emotions accurately It is also very likely that your daughter does not understand  the permanence of death Having said that she is using some very specific ideas here and I would recommend contacting a local mental health professional with some experience working with childrenI would also wonder where she is getting this idea Sometimes children hear things on TV or from an adult and we are not even aware of how much they are rememberingIt may be helpful to teach her things that she can do when she is angry like say that she is mad because she cannot have the toy that she is asking forIm curious as to how long it is that she stays mad like this and whether she talks to her dad after she is no longer angry Does she say the same sorts of things about youIt may also be helpful for you to work with a mental health professional possibly the same one who is working with your daughter so that you can have some support with this as well
"emotions, symptoms, situations, addicted to child pornography, felony charges, pandering, minors, teenagers, issues, pornography addiction, strain, therapist, repented, kept information, minimized, constant, living with, should be told",If the daughters are old  mature enough to understand substance abuse  They should be told for their own empowerment KNOWLEDGE is their power of safety and protection
"adolescent, overweight, disrespectful, doesn't listen, problem, dealing with, emotions, symptoms, situations",I would be curious about there potentially being some emotional or physical trauma in your daughters history that she is struggling with Physical trauma is usually easier to identify but emotional trauma can be feeling a lack of emotional connection in her important relationships having experienced bullying or some other emotional injury The fact that there are some defiance symptoms going on suggests that she might be in need of a safe place to process what shes going through and the potential issue with control or meeting emotional needs with food is also concerning I would recommend looking for a therapistcounselor who works with childrenadolescents in the area of addressing trauma for an assessment They may be able to ask the right questions to see whether trauma is truly the issue
"emotions, symptoms, situations, counselor, take sides, parent, order, child, tell, every detail, happened, visitation, build a case, child custody","I see a few issues hereFirst the age of the child is important  If the child is considered an
adult by state law with regard to counseling states differ on this
 the range is typically between age 13 and age 18 no one is allowed to
be in the session without the childs consentSecond ethical and legal standards generally require that a
counselor be in the role of a therapist or in the role of an evaluator but
not both  This means that a counselor
should not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who should
have custody of a childThird knowing the details of any parenting plan or
separation agreement is important 
Generally either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child and
can be present during the childs sessions 
If a court order parenting plan or separation agreement specifies that
one of the parents has sole decision making authority then only that parent can
consent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the childs
sessionsIn a situation like this I would strongly recommend seeking
out legal advice specific to your state law"
"adolescent, peed his pant, wrapped up in a video game, taken away games, punishment, pees his pants",Sounds as though your son is pissed off about somethingPunishment will most likely result in more of the same not less of the peeing you would like to stop from happeningLaziness is more of a social judgement than it is a characteristic of its own meritIs this your description of your son or his description of himselfFirst step always before addressing any of the family dynamics emotions and psychology of the people involved is a medical rule out as to why your son pees at times he plays video gamesIf he has medical clearance that there is no physiological  problem then talk with your son on his opinions as to why he pees if he is aware of the urge to pee and ignores it or that his attention gets so absorbed he doesnt notice the urge to peeSee what modifications you can create by cooperating with your sonMaybe it is as simple as each two hours he sets a timer and when it goes off he takes a bathroom break
"worried, should be worried, do something, something about it",It can be tricky to figure out if a child is truly satisfied with his lack of friendships Parents can usually tell when their child is happy But kids who are unhappy may be masking disappointment perhaps acting out their feelings in an aggressive manner Others may internalize symptoms appearing sad or withdrawn A parent may learn a great deal by asking the teachers questions such as whether the child works with others on group projects or if he eats lunch alone A parent can also talk with the recess supervisor about what happens on the playground and whether your child stays on the sidelines of play unsure of how to join the group Therespectfully is a difference between kids who are shy but happy and kids who feel isolated because they do not know how to make friends Itis not necessarily that there is something wrong with that child but they will in fact need help and suggestions for breaking into a peer group Ask a child if there is someone he would like to have over to play If a mom or dad can make the play dates happen or if they hit on an activity the child truly enjoys the young person may begin to forge friendships on their own I encourage wellmeaning parents to choose words carefully Use phrases like Hey I noticed something or Let me help you be successful By showing respect parents should feel more comfortable nudging their children beyond their comfort zoneWhen to seek professional help When does isolation raise a red flag for longterm issues True personality disorders are not typically diagnosed until adulthood Still professional counseling should be considered if the antisocial behavior is causing the child significant distress perhaps keeping him from functioning in everyday activities Also parents should pay attention to how the childs social behavior changes over time such as social anxiety The vast majority of children who define quality time as time alone are perfectly happy healthy and normal If the child is able to nurture at least one friendship exhibiting what experts call social reciprocity then parents can relax and can cherish that child who enjoys the pleasure of his or her own company
"get along, belittling, scolds, all out war, don't support, never loved, horrible names, pushes buttons, call names",As frustrating and probably hurtful as your daughters comments sound theres also a message in them about how she genuinely feelsTo some degree your daughter and you may both feel similarly misunderstood by the otherDeveloping ways of listening and talking to one another to better understand how you each feel would probably help a lotOne major point to be aware is that the motherdaughter relationship dynamic because it is strong may slow the new dynamic of relating as two adultsWatch for your own tendency to expect your daughter to consider you as a parenting authority instead of considering her as a grown personThe same is true of your daughter  She may need to remind herself to talk to you as the adult she isHer needs from you are real they just need to be spoken to you in an adult way
"legal guardianship, acting out, wants to talk, mom not talked to, handle",Hi Boone This depends a lot on his age and the situation The younger the child is in general the more I would see this as your decision not his A child of any age should be listened to carefully about these matters but just because a child has unresolved issues about a parent doesnt necessarily mean that having contact is a good solution Some questions Was the parent harmful to the child Is the parent likely to be harmful to the child How likely is it to be a positive experience Do you have any contact with the parent You may want to speak with the parent first to determine whether they are in a stable enough place to allow this to happen  I would start by asking the child more about what is on his mind What does he want to get out of a visit with the parent Is it to see them and know the parent is okay to get an apology to apologize for a perceived hurt to have regular contact to find out if they are loved What does he hope mom or dad might do or say in the visit There are many possible goals this child might have in mind This will give you a sense of whats missing for the child what need are they trying to fill Once you know the need try to determine the likelihood of that need being met successfully through contactOnce you determine the risk of the childs need not being met then you decide whether it makes sense  The older the child the more able they are to determine this with you or for themselves There are other options than a facetoface He can write to his mom or dad text or email Its likely that the child is looking for a sense that he is loved wanted worth some effort When a child is separated from a parent they tend to blame themselves Whether he sees the parent or not he will need extra love attention and support than a child who has two loving present parents I wish him the best and Im grateful for the love and support you continue to give your grandson Youre very special
"divorced, happily remarried, blended family, children, youngest, crazy, abusive, injuries, child support, sacrifices, single mom, relationship, hurts, handle",Hi Arkansas Your situation sounds like a case of parental alienation Your expartner unfortunately has the power to say things to your children that poison their relationship with you Its a form of woman abuse and child abuse Hes likely doing this to hurt you and have power over you and hes not considering how its affecting the kids Ive seen this happen in many families parents who once had a strong loving relationship with their children suddenly feel abandoned in favor of the other parent In some cases children actually stop having contact with one parent who is left bewildered and powerless Its your exs job to support your relationship with your kids not try to destroy it While you cant change his behaviours and I think you know that there are things you can do for yourself and your kids For your children you can refuse to enter into the war hes setting up Hes trying to provoke you into acting crazy but you dont have to fall for this If you run around screaming hes lying it only makes you look more crazy Try to stay calm and dont put their dad down to them no matter how tempting it is One day they may be ready to hear the truth of your relationship with their father but wait until they ask Trust that they have their own experience of their dad and trust that he doesnt have the power to destroy their love for you Children in the long term lose respect for parents who denigrate the other parent They see who their dad is already Id bet but they dont know how to cope with that If hes the only one fighting a war youre helping them feel less trapped in a parental conflict Dont engage on his level Dont blame your children completely Although I have to say that for them to call you names like crazy is not acceptable and you dont need to tolerate that disrespect try to deal with this behaviour without bringing their dad into it They are acting out their fathers agenda likely because they instinctively see his weakness Children often support the weaker parent rather than abandon them You get the worst because they trust your love But you can still have boundaries Letting them abuse you isnt the answer but have compassion for their position This picture isnt their fault but as adults they can be held accountable for their choicesReassure yourself that you are the mom you know you are You dont need them to gush all over you in order to know that you made sacrifices Hold onto the likelihood that some day they will come back and be grateful It may take a while you cant rush it but they will see you for who you are Your power is in giving them a consistently calm generous connected supportive mom who refuses to play games or be walked on Id recommend trying to connect with other parents who experience this phenomenon or a therapist who can reinforce these goals and help keep you grounded Good luck
"emotions, upset, stable, neglect, overstep, blame, alcohol addictions",Hi New York Im happy to hear that your daughter doesnt know about her dads addictions Although you dont say how old she is and I imagine that at some point in her life she will be ready to know the truth I trust your instinct that now is not the time Your ability to have clear boundaries about what is adult conversation and what is suitable for a child to know are really important here and I can tell youre being appropriately protective and a thoughtful parent As much as this helps your daughter I sense that you also know you cant take away the emotional pain that comes from having an absent parent Children tend to blame themselves for a parents absence These children need extra love and support wherever they can get itYou say that you feel like there is a wedge between you and your daughter I understand that having your ex partners relatives in the same home would make it uncomfortable at times It is very important to establish boundaries only you should parent your daughter but its also natural for people to want to assist you Lets trust that their intentions are good if there is no evidence to the contrary As much as they support you they also  have emotional ties to your daughters father While there is potential for discomfort in this complex situation there are also many positive factors here that I invite you to seeI dont know what your culture is but for your daughter to have the opportunity to preserve her fathers heritage language and a relationship with his family are potentially wonderful additions to her life In general the more adults around loving and supporting a child the better It could be that you are feeling threatened by small moments where there appears to be a special connection between your daughter and her fathers family Nothing anyone else does can take your daughters love from you My hope for you is that you can feel so secure in your own position as loving mother that you will not feel intimidated by other positive connections your daughter has They are potentially wonderful connections and she deserves your support in maintaining those relationships if they dont harm herI suggest that the most important alliances to work on here are between you and your exs family If you could all give your daughter the gift of a healthy united supportive and loving safety net for herthats the best outcome of all
"broke up, dating, spent weekends, interaction, approach situation, right thing, child",Hi Tampa I get that this is a loss for all of you you have bonded with this child as a result of the significant time you have spent with him Hes a lucky boy to have had you all taking care of him Certainly it seems that his mother might not be making the best decision for her son if you are willing to maintain the relationship it would be good for him to still have that contact In my book the more people loving a child the better But ultimately she has the right to make these decisions To oppose her wont likely do any good You can focus on grieving this relationship and supporting your brother through his loss as well
"mentally ill, cuts herself, psychiatric hospitals, voices in her head, shock therapy treatments, medication, parental rights taken away, custody, insinuating, wants to babysit, saying no",Hi FontanaThanks for providing all the details needed in order to respond to your question It seems very clear to me that no would be the appropriate response I like your healthy boundaries and Ill help you explore possible ways to respond to her First she hasnt asked yet and you dont know that she will Right now you can pleasantly ignore her hints Theyre not hurting you and if you ignore them theyre more likely to go away You can address and reduce your own anxiety about the possibility of her asking by reassuring yourself that you have the right as parents to make this decision and that if shes offended that doesnt mean that youre being mean it means that she has unrealistic expectations So the first goal is to put it out of your mind as a worry You might never have to face that moment But I understand that you want to be preparedAs her son perhaps your husband is the best one to answer the question should it ever come Is he willing to do this But if you are comfortable and if youre the one she asks you can confidently give her a simple honest response about why it wont happen And I would suggest presenting a firmly closed door rather than saying but maybe later No need to apologize or hum and hawWe love that you want to be around Junior and we definitely want you in hisher life try to leave out the but here Youre not in a healthy place and were not comfortable with you caring for himher on your ownIf she pushes the issue this is evidence of her denial or inappropriate boundaries Id let her know that its not negotiable that you understand if shes disappointed but youre not open to discussing the issue Really theres nothing to discuss Learning not to take responsibility for her emotions is part of having an ill person in your life I wish you the best
"biological father, last three years, domestic violence, child abuse, visitation with supervision, refuses to see him, therapist, after the therapy",Has the father or the visitation supervisor contacted you regarding why your daughter hasnt shown up for the past three years worth of supervised visitationOr is the supervised visitation a new development for the bio dad and your daughterIf no one is pressuring or expecting your daughter to show up no one has even asked where she is why she isnt present then I dont see any reason for you to offer more effort by your daughter than the father is willing to make for seeing herIf your daughter is willing to talk with a therapist then let her find out first hand if the sessions seem useful or notThe one move Id avoid is to force your daughter to go to a therapist since growing up in a household in which child abuse took place being forced may remind her of her own feelings from this past of feeling no one heard or cared about the way she wanted to be treated
"relationship for two years, infant son, previous relationship, live together, awful relationship, unbearable, constant arguing, negativity, move away, horrible relationship, visit, negative environment, family together, relationship end, kids' lives.",Hi BethlehemYou have a big decision to make  I appreciate your fiancés need to stay close to his child and be a standup dad and I am glad that you know your son needs an emotionally safe placeIm a bit confused because the obvious answer seems to be that you and your fiancé would get your own place together I get that you want your dad to take care of all of you but maybe its time to take responsibility for your own future and start building it independently of either parent I say that without knowing how old you are but if you have a child and a two year relationship you basically have declared your independence anyway  I wish you the best
"deviant act, concerned, 10",Well its certainly unusual and potentially could be cause for alarm Its a passive aggressive act if done intentionally so I would wonder if this child is trying to say somethingI think without any context however or sense of whether there are other signs of disturbance its impossible to say whats going on If there are other signs of distress or very unusual behaviours you might bring the child to someone who can assess him properly
"boyfriend, child, weekend, funks, mom died, disrespectful, swears, talks back, apart, blames behavior, young, adult time, golden child, won't listen",Hi Lockport Building a relationship when there are already children involved is very tricky You dont tell us whether you live together or not If you do your position is perhaps more difficult because his daughters behaviours affect you you live in the home A bottom line for me is you dont tell someone else how to parent Thats for your boyfriend to decide When hes there hes the parent and he makes the decisions about how she is disciplined or not Even if you have good ideas or you completely disagree or you think you see something that hes not seeing its simply not for you to interfere there It sounds like your boyfriend is struggling emotionally and needs support He has had a lot of losses in his life and maybe every time his daughter leaves he feels powerless and abandoned Do you talk about these things Can you find that line of supporting him but not telling him what to doAlthough I suggest you leave the parenting to him what you can do is tell him what you see offer suggestions if hes open to it and talk about the ways in which the situation affects you It makes sense to say I see you struggling and I dont know how to help Ive noticed that you seem afraid to discipline her Are you aware that its coming across this way Do you need help or I feel sad and frustrated when we dont spend any time alone together You sound a bit resentful of his daughter Is it possible that your real struggle is about whether youre ready to be in a relationship with a man whose priority is his childYou have a voice and its great to offer support and ideas and let him know how you feel Ultimately however you are wise to accept this man as who he is and accept the situation for what it is and make your own decision about whether you want to be a part of it
"desperate, hold on to the magic of Christmas, lie, real, memories, lose out, trust",Well Boise the cats out of the bag now isnt it I love that you want to help your kids keep the magic of Christmas They must want that too if they still believe in Santa into their teen years which is unusual I believe I wonder if they had already figured it out anywayBut they know now and your ex had the right to tell them if he felt it was best So its time to explain to them what a loving and magical thing it is that parents do and Christmas can still be magical in so many ways Really who says they have to stop believing in Santa Santa is very real as a spirit of surprise generosity and love
"adolescent son, daughter, driving me nuts, fighting, wits end, get them to stop, get along",That is a good question Unfortunately there is no generic answer with this one Kids fight for different reasons  wanting attention wanting respect feeling jealous wanting space and to be left alone or a whole bunch of other reasons Regardless of the underlying motivations for fighting most conflicts result from misunderstandings and assumptions about the motivations of others and one of the best ways to start figuring out what is going on is to sit them down and have some conversations with them These conversations should be centred on getting a better understanding of why they are angry with each other and really understanding them It is important that they each know that you are committed to understanding their experience rather than simply sitting them down and lecturing them about what they are doing wrong The more they are able to understand each other and feel understood the more likely they will be cooperative and considerate of each other One exercise for doing this that can be very helpful is active listening where one person speaks and the other person reflects back what they heard the other person say and then checks for understanding This is hard to do but it often illuminates where the misunderstandings and assumptions are If this doesnt work it may be time to get a family therapist or counsellor involved who can help facilitate dialogue and resolve conflict
"toilet training, throws up, gagging, refuses to use, sits there forever, holds poop in, fear, stress",Your son is showing signs that hes just not ready to be toilet trained You dont say how old he is so Im not sure whether the problem is deeper but right his fears may reflect that right now he is simply be not ready to take that step Pushing him at this point could worsen the problem so I suggest pulling back the expectations waiting a month or two looking for more signs of readiness and trying again In general teaching children to use the toilet works best when mistakes are handled calmly and when parents pay close attention to cues that the child is responding positively
"emotions, symptoms, situations, pregnant, boyfriend, parents, gynecologist, doctors appointments, supportive, lost, hopeless, guidance, wrong, keeping him away, communication, selfish",Youre not wrong for wanting to be with your boyfriend of three years who is also the biological father of your childDo your parents object to you and your boyfriend continuing to see each other in person  Or do they object only to electronic communication and dont want him involved in his childs life Ask your parents what their reason is for forbidding you to communicate with your boyfriend  Ask them also to understand your point of viewNow is also a good time for you and your boyfriend to plan whether and where you will live as a family and how to financially and emotionally support one another once your baby is bornYour mom and dad are definitely making fatherhood difficult for your boyfriend and motherhood stressful for youConsider bringing up the topic during your next obgyn visit  Your doctor may ask your mom to explain her reasons and address theseLook online for womens resources to see if there are clinics or agencies that would help you advocate for your position in this matterGood luck with the remainder of your pregnancy labor and delivery
"incorrect approach, defending my son, harsh behavior, working on science assignment, encourage him to study, upset, swearing at me, threatened me, scared me",I have had these many cases but in situations like this If it does get out of hand the police do need to be involved Sit down and talk to your husband when he is calm and collective
"abusive father, killed my rapist, lost custody, served 5 years, sad memories, leaving daughter, close mother daughter relationship, cruel verbally, angry at the world, afraid of God, drank, cussed out, feeling guilty, afraid of being evicted",Was either parent abusive or violent toward youYou sound to have suffered emotionally in your relationships since early in lifeOne point to consider is to strive for moderation in what you offer in relationshipsA lot of what youve lived through is extreme either as victim or perpetratorIf you imagine that apologizing to the custodian for the way spoke to him would calm him down do soAt the very least youll be actively resolving your guilt over cussing at him and fear of his retaliation
"regret, hurting, love, nothing works, always love, with them, nothing else matters, more than anything, raising my kids",How you you expressed your regret and taken responsibility for the pain thus far Repair is a very essential skill in and part of developing healthy relationships Your love sounds deep sit with that Also sit with how shes been hurt You get to feel your hurt too and your kids In feeling all this you may also find our way to the repair If feeling all this is tough to take on seek out a local therapist to support your process
"step child, 8 year old boy, choke, daughter, 6 year old girl, going on, 4 years, tells, not to tell, wrong, time out, spanking, taking away toys, sitting on the wall, afraid, daughter's safety",I can see why you are alarmed That is a scary situation for a parent Do you know if the child has been evaluated by a mental health professional Early treatment is often the key A professional will be able to help the child learn how to control their anger and mend the troublesome actions into more appropriate responses Have you addressed your concerns with the childs other parent There could be contributing factors in his life that could be causing these issues exposure to violence sexualphysical abuse drug use stressful events in his life etc It is important that these factors are identified so that they can either be eliminated andor reduced I wouldnt hesitate to have him evaluated if he hasnt been already and to ensure that he is getting the help that he needs whether it be medication andor therapy Until then I would make sure that he is always supervised under an adults care
"friends, hooked up, girlfriend, happy, upset, hook up",If you mean hooked up as having sex with no care for the person and youd like a girlfriend then realize relationships require more complex alignment with a partner than being a sex buddyPay attention to all your feelings toward a girl so that youll approach someone who attracts you for reasons in addition to sexual allureAlso the process of knowing someone takes much more time than only to sleep with someoneHave patience and kindness toward yourself while you get to know the qualities which attract you to a potential girlfriend
"hopeless, not good enough, trying hard enough, worn out, worked on family relationships, doing great in school, kind to those in need, stick to religious beliefs, leave room for mistakes, learn from others, nothing works, feel hopeless",Hello and let me say first what a great question There are so many people putting forth their 100 everyday and often times do not get the credit they deserve Without being able to fully understand where youre question is coming from I think there are a couple of different ways to look at this questionFirst I think its important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that youre not good enough Is that ACTUALLY what they said or is this just what you heard Sometimes because of our own selfdoubts and fears we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others Again listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective Is the message being sent coming from a place of love or concern If so have an honest and open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding the amount of energy and time youre spending on being good enough Explore with them how you feel your already giving your bestIf the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have then it may be time to explore the relationship Some relationships we engage in can be toxic especially if the other person is toxic It may be they have their own stuff going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better If youre in the direct path of this individual then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire as well Explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life If its a relationship that MUST continue then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their problems Until theyre willing to work on these issues for themselves then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation Another perspective of this question is exploring the reason why its important for YOU to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals NO ONE will ever be 100 good enough for EVERYONE Every single person has their own set of expectations in themselves and expectations in others It would be impossible to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives The question becomes what is it WITHIN you that feels the need to meet these expectations There is most likely a part of you yourself as an individual that feels less than and feels as if you yourself are not good enough It then becomes impossible to every feel good enough for others because its really YOU youre trying to feel good enough for If you already feel as if youre doing everything you can do to be at your best version of yourself then really work on LETTING GO of the rest No one is perfect and striving for perfection in our lives only creates more anxiety and stress Find a middle ground in which you are happy with your accomplishments and your daily goals and learn to let go of whats left After all tomorrow is a new day and you can work on more of your goals tomorrowI recommend doing this by finding a mantra a statement or phrase you can repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure from striving for perfection The mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation I leave you with one of my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra No one can make you feel inferior without your consent   Eleanor Roosevelt
"stroke, passed away, lost my home, lost my job, looking for a job, binge watching television, binge eating",HelloI write to respond to your recent inquiry for possible increase in selfesteem and positive behavioral change regarding motivation for a new job First of all please try to allow yourself some time for grief of the loss of your dear grandmother It appears you were close to her in many ways and she had a great influence in your life The grief process of anger denial despair and acceptance may be a part of what is keeping you feeling stuck in a cycle of not feeling motivated to find work at this time  Perhaps your mind is constantly fighting this grief Death can be a traumatic experience for some people and is considered a great loss thus the grief process may continue to be a part of your world for a time but hopefully not keep you stuck on a longterm basis  I would try to reach out to a counselor to discuss this grief process at a deeper level to discern whether her death is part of why you feel this way  Grief and loss can also have an effect on your selfesteem  Can you begin to see how this cycle is what you may be experiencing One positive I see is that you are continuing to look for a new job  Take time to give yourself some credit for the  time you are spending looking for work  Also I would recommend you set some shortterm goals first for example make a list of 510 potential new employers and send them each your resume Then followup the next week with an email or phone call to make sure the hiring manager or human resources received your resume and have any questions  It is also a good idea to ask for informational interviews in order to get your foot in the door so to speakI hope that this information is helpful to you  Please let me know if you have any questions or concernsWarmlyDenise
"feel like, hate myself, physically, emotionally, accepting myself, more confident",Youve already taken the first step You want to not hate yourself Selfacceptance is hard And its on a spectrum On one side we have selfhate on the other extreme selflove And then there is all this stuff in the middle It kind of looks like thisAnd working toward selflove often means moving around through all these Becoming aware of your emotions exploring the parts of you you that easier and harder to accept selfkindness selfforgiveness selfcompassion and ultimately selflove It is a recovery process and has to be an active thing each day Meeting with a counselor can give you a partner in that process Your counselor can also help you to recognize pieces that may be more difficult to see from your eyes as they have an outside view And with selfacceptance confidence comes naturally although you may need to practice behaviors that show assertiveness confidence and boundaries that protect you Wishing you the absolute best with this
"emotions, scares, feeling unwanted, alone, great woman, really like me, dont know how to process, bothering both of us",Congrats on having a happiness problemGo slowly and tell your partner how you feel as you discover how being loved feelsOn a deep level youre releasing yourself from interaction patterns which treated you poorly and unkindlyTime is needed of repeated occurrences of this newfound loving behavior toward youGradually you will trust more and more that your new living relationship life is your reality

"ugly, change, tried, bullied, weight, ugliness, whole life, believe, thinking, parents, fat, therapist, fine, deal with",Hey  I am so impressed with your efforts to ask questions to figure out how to change the messages that you hear and say to yourself and to get support  And it sounds like you want to make some changes in your life  Take a walk over to the counseling office at school the school nurse or consider reaching out to your Pediatricians office You dont have to have your parents permission to seek support for yourself  And maybe taking control of your support network will give you the strength to make even bigger decisions about your health  I am rooting for you  Be Wise
"abandonment issues, childhood, worthy of happiness, afraid, doing something wrong, scenarios, believe",This is an understandable response to early childhood trauma and loss  Oftentimes when we have overwhelming or difficult experiences as a child including poor caregiving the ways we managed and the feelings we had then show up in our lives as adults  Especially when we get close to someone it mirrors our early experiences with caregivers in early life  Soour body nervous system and emotions respond in the same way  They feel as if what we experienced when we were little is happening now and they go into full force to manage and protect us  Sometimes the ways that happens can feel pretty bad and we can stuck in these loops of old beliefs about ourselves  Therapy is a great way to interrupt these patterns process the early experiences and be able to be in the present with your current relationships  It is very possible to shift this cycle and also have meaningful healing from the experiences that caused so much hurt and distress from childhood
"feeling pressured, ton of stress, bullied, sinking in, cant stop, bad about myself",You may have reached the natural end point of working very hard in school and putting up with bullies or not knowing how to step to the side of people who bully youBoth conditions you have been living under pressure to perform well in school and the tension of someone bullying you are quite drainingNow is probably time to recuperate from your emotional ordealHobbies may be a little too lighthearted and distracting from the more major task of grounding yourself in feeling secure and settled especially after such arduous effort academically and sociallyLet your natural self guide youIf right now you need to simply grow strong again then allow this process to slowly developEventually all on its own when the time is right you will find a hobbyNow is your time to trust yourself to live the rhythms of your life
"teenage girl, feel very bad, weight, make it stop",One way may be to take some sort of physical movement class in which you will be regarded by the teacher as one of the students not the girl who weighs a certain amountIn a movement class such as pilates yoga aerobics weights dance when the standard for clothing is somewhat fitted and shows more of our physical bodies than regular clothing and to be considered as one of the students not stigmatized for how much or how little you weigh may help you be as accepting of yourself as the teacher is of you
"fighting all the time, jumps to conclusions, family-oriented, abused, ignored, messed up, mentally, forced out, mad, homeless, guidance, hit each other, dying, relationship healthy, advice",Hello It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now Marriages take lots of work and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young  good bad or indifferent There are no easy answers to your questions and I wont presume that my response to you will be the linchpin that heals all your pain But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections First and foremost cut yourself some slack No one is perfect We fail more often than we succeed but in the end we learn and that learning helps us grow Yes youre right the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good and need to stop You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor Seeing a therapist for yourself and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach You have issues that you need to resolve that while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life they are separate from your marriage in many respectsJoining a marriage support group can also be helpful You can find these through local counseling resources Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful If you belong to a religious or spiritual community then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for youLastly parents are imperfect Yepits true They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage We limp along and do our best Having said that we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life Both with ourselves and toward other people So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit  I am sure that remains to be seen but either way you both must be involved in saving it If only one of you cares then 100 of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person Thats not fair So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants and work to create an amicable solution All of this said seek out supportive friends and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life One way or the other you will benefit from itBe well
"Water Safety Instructor, proper swimsuit, displaying everything, embarrassed",I also want to note that we as a society are especially judgemental about how women dress and present themselves  I am sorry that this boy said something insensitive  There is nothing shameful about your body and it was not your intention to display everything  It also wasnt his place to judge you As women we are expected to be sexy in some situations and demure in others  Men dont have the same range of societal expectations to navigate  You didnt deserve his rudeness
"emotions, insecurity, deception, embarrassment, self-consciousness, body image, social anxiety",I get how you feel you wish your body looked different and youre embarrassed that you tried to make it look different and people may notice You dont say how old you are Its likely that if you are young your body will change as you mature but in general were given the bodies were given and Im glad to see that there may be a desire in you to accept your body the way it is You seem to want to stop disguising it Bodies come in all shapes and sizes and every woman knows how it feels to struggle with accepting what hers looks like Many men go through this as well although women are more often targeted with cultural messages about how were supposed to look Young people often believe that others are noticing and judging them In fact other people are far more preoccupied with who might be judging them than whatevers going on with you I suggest you wear whatever bra you want to wear and if someone is rude enough to comment on it you can ignore them and talk about the weather or the latest pop song that you love and theyll get the hint But my bet is they wont even notice
"feel like, never fully meet, finish it, think, picked someone else, want nothing to do with",It sounds like you have the perception that people are frequently disappointed in you wish you were different or someone else and ultimately reject you One question I would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way Is there anything in peoples words or behaviors that gives you this impression If your not sure it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you even though you perceive these attitudes within them Additionally working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of selfesteem and security in your relationshipsOne possibility that comes to mind of which there may be more is that as we grow up we often develop relational templates or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships Sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our selfesteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult You ask a great question here and one that can be very hard to see through given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way and I hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answer

"hate, dont like, stressing me out, dont trust, dont know what to do",This is so very common in this crazy looksobsessed world I meet so many beautiful people who cant see their beauty Is there something getting in the way for you Was there a time in your life when people teased you or told you something hurtful or did something to you that made you feel ugly If so this can be addressed first Sometimes stories are told about us when were young and the best thing we can do is see the authors evil or careless intent and not take that on A therapist can help you with this partOnce youve addressed any past barriers to feeling confident you can focus on a few simple things First your thoughts If you keep telling yourself that you dont like what you see then you will never feel okay about your looks Experiment with telling yourself something different Look in the mirror and I dare you to find something thats lovely about your face Focus on that Describe what you see If you were your own best friend what would you say about your face Eliminating those negative scripts and building new positive ones will help you feel more accepting of how you look You cant change your face but you can change your attitude towards your face Confidence is the things that will make you beautifulAccepting how you look is important Without going to plastic surgery the popularity of which is a testimony to how nuts this whole thing has become you were born with that nose those eyes those lips Accepting yourself and knowing it wont change is a good idea because wishing it were different wont make it soLooking good is also about minimizing flaws and building on your assets Are you in a rut about hairstyle or makeup Ask a good friend to give you a makeover Play with your features and wardrobe There are plenty of average looking people who know how to make themselves shine because they are creative
"insecure, afraid, embarrassing, not good enough, worry, appearance, facial expression",Hi Im glad you wrote because I think a lot of people have this same issue to different degrees and we dont talk about it much You have some social anxiety that is a bit beyond what the average person might feel Most people have some amount of worry about what others might think of them and this probably prevents us from making complete fools of ourselves so thats a good thing But your alarm system is out of whack and you are spending too much time worrying about how you come across As you age you understand this more and its truethat other people really arent thinking about you much or monitoring you at all theyre too busy having the same thoughts youre having Am I good enough Do people like me judge methink Im weird Were all concerned about how we come across far more than how others come across Like many people you lack compassion for yourself acceptance of yourself and confidence in yourself My gut says that these things came from somewhere in your past Our sensitivities usually come from as well as genetics a specific time in our life when we experienced or felt something that was overwhelming and we end up with an alarm system that overreacts at times Without more details its difficult to go further here I recommend you see a therapist who does cognitive behavioural therapy which can help you understand the roots of your fears and learn how to manage them more successfully
"drinking problem, gets trashed, apologizes constantly, feels validated, thinks everyone hates her, asks if you hate me, tells me you love me, pity her, suicidal",It does sound like your roommate may have a drinking problem and the short answer is that you cant do anything about it only she can We cant change what other people say think or do We can only change our reactions It does sound like your roommate may be having a hard time You can suggest that she enter counseling or therapy You can reassure her that you like her if thats true but you dont have to pity her
"impress people, need to impress, hate me, feel this way",My first reaction to this is that It sounds like you rely alot on the impressions and projections of the outside world that you need validation from other people to compensate for a lack of something on the inside build yourself up on the inside work on yourself use positive affirmations daily it would be wise for you to research some selfconstruct theory and do some selfconcept workHope this helpsC
"feel like, born in the wrong body, should be a girl, not a boy, wanted to be a girl, what I was wasn't me, family is against transgender people, want to be me, happy, don't like my reflection, taking things to help, not prescribed, handled by a professional",Hi Do you have any opportunity to work with a therapist  It sounds like it might be really great to explore these feelings If you arent able to there are many awesome gender work books available that you could use to explore your thoughts and feelings Also  google ask a gender therapist  so many amazing video blogs to answer many questions  Good luck
"feel, stuck, serious relationship, worthless jobs, meditation, fix",Being stuck in life is difficult especially when you are feeling it in many different areas of your life So you if you are ready for a change time to make one Make a list of the resources in your areacommunity colleges friends free classes volunteer opportunities etc Make a list of your passions and absolute no way things in life Make a 5 year plan where do you want to be in 5 years then start breaking it down  what do I need to do this year to make it to next year Break that down into months check in with friendsfamiliesco workers etc to see what they see in you both good and bad Take a deep breath and choose 1 thing to work on to get better in life according to them Seek out any free trainingcounseling on career changes and life changes You already began this by asking this forum for help Awesome Use the peace and calm you find in meditation to spring board you to make some changes in your behaviortry new things change poor choices etc Use the meditation to give you peace while you make the changes Good Luck
"forgive myself, ashamed, guilty, loved ones, summer, happened, feel",Hello and thank you for your question Guilt is one of those things that nearly everyone has experienced at one time or another and it can feel like a huge weight around your neck Unfortunately it is unlikely that we can give you some words of wisdom that will make it all go away However I will give you some ideas and hopefully this will helpOne of the things that we know about guilt is that it doesnt usually do much to help us in the longrun People may make changes for a shortterm period of time because they feel guilty about something they did but usually they will go back to their old behaviors if they dont have something else to help them change permanently such as a new skill So guilt doesnt necessarily help us In fact as I write this someone out there is eating an entire key lime pie because they feel guilty about falling off their diet Someone may be drinking alcohol because they feel guilty about drinking alcohol For whatever reason this is just a common thing that we do Now accountability is different than guilt Accountability can actually be constructive  When you hold yourself accountable you can admit that you have done something wrong That it hurt others and you deeply regret it That you are prepared to take steps to make sure it doesnt happen again That you have done what you can to make amends if necessary That you are sorry And then you move on Why is moving on necessary Well for one thing it doesnt usually help the people who you hurt In fact someones guilty behavior may serve to remind the people who were hurt over and over again about what happened Guilt is usually 100 about us and not about those we hurt Also guilt can lead us to behave in ways that may even hurt people more Having said all of that guilt is a normal human emotion Sometimes we experience it for a while and it goes away Sometimes we need help to work through it There are many selfhelp books about forgiving yourself You can try Amazon to find some or consider getting help from a counselor Be wellRobin Landwehr DBH LPC NCC
"feel like everyone is up against me, trying their best to shut me down, ruining my mood, trouble sleeping, sleep paralysis, dreaming of others mocking and judging me",The problem you describe sounds very wearing on your spiritAre there particular reasons for why you feel everyone hates youHave you been in a clash of ideas or opinions and feel yourself in the minority viewpointOr does your sense of being shut out start within your own mind as though you anticipate that others will not like what you sayIf actual conversations are leading you to feel left out then evaluate whether to bring up certain points to the other personOr you may also decide that the relationships in which you feel shut out are no longer worthwhile ones for youIf the problem is hesitating to interact because you imagine others will reject you then maybe you can coach yourself into trying a small step toward introducing yourself and your thoughts to others
"feel like, convince myself, okay, blocking out, bad things, forgetting, nobody cares, truly alone","I can relate When things are going badly I feel like my life has
always been and will always be that way But I also do this when things are
going well That is I forget how good things can turn bad Personally to
avoid this emotional rollercoaster I try and heed the famous advice by author
and feminist Rita Mae Brown One of the keys to happiness is a bad
memorySo maybe this weakness of your for forgetting is really a
strength It sounds a lot like living in the moment to me And while its hard
to manage my past and my future the moment seems like a small enough piece of
temporal real estate to sort out So thats the what of my answer The how
goes like this Choose one from column A two from column B and three from
column C in the following chart Then try doing them for as long as you can
Then see what happensA                                            B                                                  CGratitude                                Forgiveness                                 AppreciationExpectations                           Meditation                                    ExerciseBitterness                               Distraction                                    Volunteering

think and believe are out of your control or that your values were imposed on
you or that nothing good will ever happen again then we will have to
respectfully disagree Youve ask a very deep and insightful question proving
that your hope has gotten you this far Hang onto that hope because Im an
example of things working out despite my previous way of looking at my lifeInstead of convincing
yourself that youre okay when youre not how about calling it accepting
yourself as okay just the way you are without judging your okayness You
probably have high standards perfectionism and thats a thing to talk with a
counselor about The opposite of perfect is not horrible Its called good
enoughBlocking out the bad things and
forgetting is as natural as eating and sleeping All the other mammals do it
except when it comes to lifethreatening bad things so why shouldnt we This
might be called optimism
Feeling alone and uncared for
is a worse feeling than being despised This is good This means I suppose
that you dont despise yourself as much as you just dont care for you because
we can often project our own selfbeliefs onto others This is an abstract
concept that will take some time to get used to But I have a suspicion that
with just a little more selfcare and a little more caring for others you
might be better off very soon"
"irritated, frustrated, angry, explode, pathetic, stupid, worthless, cant take this anymore",Yeah I get the same problem Look Im not a professional but Ive heard a few things a powernap can help just a half hour of sleep can clear your mind and let you refocus Also brain activity increases with physical exertion Just walk around for a minute and get your brain working and thatll help you reach the task at hand Taking breaks it totally okay Try to have something to do in between that you enjoy
"mother of my child, years",I would think that you hold little self worth and feel that you are not worthy of better  I would suggest that you get to know yourself   What do you NEED in a relationship  What is holding you to this relationship other than your child  What have gone on in the relationship that makes you think or feel you deserve such disrespect  Just a few questions to ask yourself
"relationship difficulties, frustration, arguing, tension, love, forgiveness, guilt, unworthiness",Hi CerritosThis is an interesting twist because its more common for the person in your position to want to move forward and for the person who was wronged to struggle with forgiveness You are lucky to have a loving compassionate partner and your boyfriend is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actions My hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here Your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made You dont have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good man You only have to have the maturity to recognise when youve hurt someone and work hard to make it better Who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made Were you shamed as a child Did you learn that you deserved to be punished Did something bad happen that you thought was your fault Is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for There is a younger person inside you waiting to be forgiven for something they werent entirely responsible for The bar is too high for you If I was your therapist I would work with you to find the source of the shame and address that wound If you want to move forward and be with your boyfriend your job will be to forgive yourself Forgiving doesnt mean it was okay forgiving simply means that it happened that you cant erase it and that you dont want to carry it around or punish yourself for it anymore You have done many things here that you can feel proud of Youve come clean youve been honest youve taken responsibility for your actions youve not tried to minimize what you did and youve chosen to be more loyal and aware of how you impact your boyfriend These are all things you can use to build your sense of worth You are acting very honourably Its time to put your past mistakes away on the shelf knowing that youve learned from them and are a better person now Its not our mistakesnot our worst moments that define usits how we handle them afterwardsI wish you growth and happiness
"self harm, asthma attack, cope, motivate, pain, cycle, healthy outlets, exercise, weapons, words",It sounds like you are feeling helpless and out of control you are concerned about your behavior and at the same time you feel compelled to continue it In working with a therapist you may be able to get insight into what is motivating these behaviors develop strategies for taking care of yourself and get a stronger sense of who you are motivated to be when you are your authentic self
"late 20s, never had a boyfriend, never been on a date, no friends, hate Facebook, everyone else has kids, great husband, great paying jobs, work in retail, can't find a job, Associate degree, upset, frustrated, worthless, everyone hates me, failure, live with Dad, embarrassing",In case knowing this helps you there are many more people in similar circumstance as you than you may realizeSimilar to you they are not on FB for the reasons you list  Plus no one wants to go on FB and tell the world they dont have a fantastic life  Everyone on FB is happy even when theyre miserable theyre happy telling everyone about itFirst yes it is painful to see all around you what appears as joyful living  Please keep in mind that the life you imagine these people have is not necessarily the true life they are having  Ive been a therapist for a long time and have seen repeatedly how people who are married with kids by age 30 start having problems by their midthirtiesSecond respect your unique identity  For whatever reason you have more sensitivity possibly more depth more complex standards and expectations of yourself and othersAs hard as it may sound or actually be take time to hear your intuition and what it tells you you need for your own growth and developmentFeeling embarrassed can also be turned into a positive  Consider it as motivation for the long term to develop new ways of reaching your goalsI hope this helps
"emotions, symptoms, betrayal, low self-esteem, pain, forgiveness, hate, gratitude, validation, obsession, nightmares",The dilemmas you present are giving you a great chance to understand your true reasons for being in a relationshipContinue developing some points youve written hereThat you grew up sensing andor witnessing your moms emotional pain from your dad cheating on her very likely set a standard in your inner self to expect similar circumstances in your relationship lifeThis is a natural dynamic which happens for all of us  What we observe in our growing up households is what we understand as normal no matter how bad it actually isAfter all children dont have the ability to separate that what their own parents do is wrong compared with the rest of our cultureIt is natural to long for a relationshipWhat you have the chance to do now is distinguish the reasons for your longingIs it to attach to someone who has hurt you hasnt shown you any understanding of having hurt you and whose validation even if he says validating words has little meaning because people who validate are not the ones who harm usIf youre able to teach yourself that those who love us do not harm us and to develop new expectations for yourself of feeling good from how your partner treats you then you will be showing yourself a road that will benefit you for your entire lifetime
"cheated on, ugly, engaged, don't like, pictures of myself",Sounds as though youre taking the blame for the bad actions of your former husbandHe did an ugly action and instead of feeling only your own emotions in response to being cheated on you are holding his ugly behavior within you and feeling itDoes this sound like a possible explanation of why your feeling of ugliness started after the cheating incidentYou may start feeling better by looking within your own heart for the full effects of having been hurt  It is possible there is more suffering within you than youve realized until nowAs you address all the emotional pain youve lived through the feeling of ugliness may drop out all of its own Because youd be focused on you not on any of the ugliness introduced into your life by your cheating ex husband
"scared, alone, deserves him, hurt him",While not wanting to be alone may not be the best reason to be in a relationship it is probably more common and normal a reason than you think  Since you seem to care about your friend dont want to hurt him I imagine there are many other reasons that you are together  I suggest that you talk about this openheartedly with each other  The idea of being afraid of being alone sounds like an honest starting place  Dont try to figure out whether you should be with him  Just talk  The communication is likely to shine light on deepening connection for BOTH OF YOUIn the meantime your idea that you dont deserve him is rooted in a core lie that you are telling yourself  You can read about core lies and much more in my book Living Yes a Handbook for Being Human  Check out wwwLivingYesorgBe easy on yourself  You are deservingMark
"attention from men, lead them on, tease, chase me, feel wanted",Hi Michigan Good for you for recognising a destructive pattern This behaviour although it might get you the attention you want initially will ultimately drive men away because its not respectful of them My gut says that you learned early on in life that your value is in your sexuality alone Thats a powerful thought You are certainly acting as if this is true If you believed in your value as a person you would be less afraid of deeper relationships and intimacy in general If I were your therapist Id have many questions for you and I would need to understand a lot of things about you and your past to help you sort out where this idea about yourself came from Id suggest reaching out to a qualified therapist who can help you get to the root of this behaviour Good luck

"love of my life, left me, broke my heart, miss her, cant seem to get over, heartbroken",Who takes care of your son is a significant part of getting over your heartbreakIf you made reasonable custody terms re your son then the relationship heartache is much easier to recover from than if your sons mother vanished from his life or if the mother wants nothing to do w himRe the actual relationship let yourself feel sad and hurt since this is the truthUsually life gradually fills in new people including a relationship once you feel strong enough from having endured such sadness and loss
"infidelities, separate, reconcile, differences, dated, expecting a baby girl, mention, break up, love",My answer is yes you should tell her because you have a child with her She is the mother of your son and this new baby would be his half sister I think telling her is mature and appropriate Usually procrastinating just makes it worseAnother thing to consider Would you want her to tell you if she was pregnant with her boyfriends baby Hope this helps take care
"relationship ended, let go, get over, move on",I think giving yourself the space to realize that this was a significant relationship and it really had an impact on you I think you should honor that relationship and then talk about it to someone The more you try to not think of it the more you will think of it I think you should instead say thank you to that relationship Thank you for showing you what qualities you like what you desire Maybe even come up with a list of what that specific relationship did for you After you say thank you to that relationship then it may be time to say goodbye You obviously want to get over that person so figure out why you want to get over them Why did it not work out What negative parts of the relationship do you keep forgetting to think about Oftentimes people glamorize the past So for your goodbye part of this phase I would focus on the negative parts of the relationship You can also work on emotionally saying goodbye to that time in your life You are probably different than you were 7 years ago and to be honest they are probably different tooI know it sounds weird But I would recommend that you mentally say thank you and goodbye to that relationship
"feelings, fell in love, difficult, move on, genuine love, without him, conditions surrounding our love, considered wrong, move on",Well there is some good news and notsogood news The good news is that people are capable of moving on from relationships even if the person showed them a sort of love that theyve never felt theyve had or deserved before Sometimes even just the fact that this has happened for them can eventually see below lead them to seek out love again because they now believe they will be able to have that againSo the notsogood news though is that one can not just move on Id even venture to say that the pressure you may be putting on yourself to just move on and out of this yucky hole of feelings that you are in is actually too much pressure and adding to the yucky feelings as they are Instead try thinking of getting past these feelings as grieving over the loss of someone even though someone didnt die there is still a significant loss you are experiencing and therefore how essential it is to allow yourself to grieve to feel whatever feelings of anger or sadness or something else that you are feeling Often it is really helpful to speak those feelings I recommend professionals in this case who can help you feel like you are not pathological for this struggle and instead that it is completely normal Love is a crazy thing and the feelings can get very confusing But the last stage of grieving is acceptance and it is very challenging to get there if you skip over denial anger bargaining and depression
"engaged, going well, downhill, broke off, opportunity, college, cheating, think about, communicating, friends, family",Somehow you knew the marriage wouldnt have a good start if your fiancé was cheating on youCongrats on your intuition and following your intuitionAn engagement breakup is full of disappointment and sometimes talking about the particular points help the couple to clarify and possibly set the relationship on new terms or feel more confident in the breakupI suggest you identify what topics re the relationship youd like to clear up with your exIf both of you are having touch and go conversation which doesnt address the deeper and more troubled areas which led to the cheating and breakup there is a chance you both will go down a similar road of casual and light conversation which hits the wall of the deeper obstacles between both of youYour friends and family dont need to know anything until you feel ready to tell them what you decide to tell them
"love, thinks about her, relationship over, appreciate, make him happy",Trust your intuition on your conclusion about this guyHe may very well love you only with the ex so prominent in his mind it is possible your feeling of not being appreciated now would multiply if ever the two of you needed to address a delicate topicSince he is emotionally attached to the former gf it is very likely he wouldnt be able to fully love you as much as youd like and are already sensing
"spouse decided, deteriorated, separated, despises, wants to be with other women, divorce, no feelings, absurdly jealous, diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, narcissist",What a burden for youYour husband cannot seem to make up his mind on his viewpoint and doesnt seem to care whether or not youre affected by speaking out of two sides of his mouthKeep yourself protected emotionally from him   Theres no good which can come by arguing with a person who  flips their positionLive as separately as possible from him and stick to roommate type matters such as groceries bill paying and housecleaning as discussion topicsIf he cannot make sense of what he thinks and feels then certainly you will face similar difficulty trying to do so
"separated, needs some time apart, in love, relationship, wait, start over new",Its not uncommon for relationships to go cold over time It is a matter of one or the other becoming complacent If you and your husband have been together for quite some time its likely that you are very comfortable and familiar with each other While this is a good thing in some ways it can also become boring and you run the risk of losing that in love feeling he is referring to Couples simply become ambivalent For some of the couples I work with in my practice I find that helping to organize a time apart which I call a Therapeutic Separation can do wonders for the relationship I offer homework to be done during this time Reading worksheets and individual counseling helps people learn more about themselves and what they desire out of their relationship It often times brings more appreciation for their partners When the pair comes back together we are able to push the reset button and begin a new chapter that is more fulfilling and exciting than before

"needed space, dating, boyfriend, miss her, likes me",Given the short amount of time you know this girlfriend there is no history on which to make a judgment about the likelihood of what she will do nextCertainly she is confusing by telling you she likes you and is with someone new  And not giving you any explanation as to why she made her decisionId suggest two possibilitiesSpeak with her and ask her if she considers opening your relationship with herOr simply wait and see what she does when you contact her in a friendly wayPay attention to your own satisfaction levelIf you get more answers from her which arent agreeable with you then it is time to put the hope for this relationship behind youThen youll have clear space to find someone who is as interested in you as you are in them
"exgirlfriend, bored, experience life single, treated badly, caused fights, remorseful, willing to do whatever it takes, unhappy, crying, text me, ready",Were you happy with the ways she satisfied youA relationship is happiest if each partner concentrates on the happiness of the otherStrange for someone who was treated badly to describe themselves as bored rather than say they feel hurtIs it possible you are being selfcritical about your behaviors toward your ex girlfriend Either she is unaware of her feelings or not being fully truthful with you about her feeling badly treatedSince shes putting up a barrier to communicating with you better for you to respect this than contact her by phone againConsider in a few weeks so each of you has time to think over your happiness with the other person to write her an email which states your interest to reopen the relationshipWho knows you may even decide by the end of a few weeks that youre fine without this particular relationshipDepending on her response to your email youll know whether and how much chance there is for the relationship to clear up the problems of the past and to continue
"broke up, cheated on, forgiving, questioning, tired, left",Cheating on you shows a lack of commitment in addition to the emotional hurt it createsProbably you didnt actually forgive him because if you did then you wouldnt have been asking questions of his every moveMaybe you were open to forgiving him   In order for forgiveness to be effective the person who has done the injuring must first show some understanding and empathy for the great pain the person caused in youFrom what you write your fiancé didnt seem to have much interest in earning back your trust or in empathizing with the way his cheating effected youIt is very likely his tiredness is also tiredness you feel of having to watch him all the timeAs uncomfortable as adjusting with the disappointment of him leaving you the situation you describe sounds like it was unsatisfying for both of you

"sexual relationship, kept it from me, confronted, telling me, works with her, sees her every day, feel, stay with him, trust, husband, ended it",Trust is a necessary factor for an intimate relationship to feel safeThe person who must repair the trust is the one who has broken this trustThe best way to find out if your husband wants to restore your trust in him is to ask him this question  He may not be willing to meet your requestIf he hesitates or becomes defensive about the need to restore your trust then ask him to think his decision through and tell him the serious consequence you are consideringAsk him to reflect for a few days or a week and then to address the topic againIf you and he consistently find that he is unwilling to do anything at all to regain your trust then I agree you have serious thinking to do as to whether or not youd be able to live within a partnership based upon trust in which you dont trust your partner

"on and off relationship, hurt, separated, difficult divorce, taking it really hard, want to end, let go",Hello and thank you for your question Boy ending relationships is tough isnt it Sometimes its tough even when we are 100 sure that it is the right thing to doI am going to give you some of my thoughts and hopefully some colleagues will add some others One of the things that I want to point out is that letting go is not really a thing In other words its not really something you can reach out and grab Its more of a process This is good news because you dont necessarily have to be at the end of the process to end an unhealthy relationship We just have to accept that there will be feelings that come up even after the relationship is over For example someone can end an unhealthy relationship today but then be reminded of the good times on what would have been their anniversary This could make the person very sad They may even regret ending the relationship for a little while It would important then for the person to remind themselves why the relationship needed to end and that they are healthier because of it This is relevant for you Its hard to walk away from a relationship We fear all kinds of things including being single Sometimes its helpful to compare what you are getting out of the relationship to what you want from a relationship Its helpful to be honest about what we have given up for an unhealthy relationship Its fine to admit uncertainly about ending things Its okay to be afraid Its okay to have moments of doubt and sadness along with a dash of guilt And even with all of that someone can still leave if it is the healthiest thing for them They can have sadness later on and still not go backIt sounds like you are feeling responsible for making sure he is okay because of this divorce The truth is that there is not necessarily a perfect time to end any relationship There would be no guarantee that he would be doing any better after the divorce Sometimes NOT making decisions stresses us out A LOT more than making a decision and living with the consequences both good and bad You may be at that crossroads Be wellRobin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC
"relationship, caring, friendly, charming, controlling, hissy fit, cheating, nasty, narcissistic, social",It sounds like you had a very confusing and painful experience in this relationship and now you feel hesitant to let yourself get close to people It is understandable that when we are hurt in relationships we may have trouble trusting and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable with othersTherapy is a great place to explore the roots of present difficulties in relationships to unpack what happened in prior relationships and to find new ways to show up in relationships so that we can have the relaxed intimacy that we want Often relationship difficulties represent patterns of relating that we learn early in life which we may feel compelled to act on outside of our awareness and therapy provides an opportunity to become more aware of these patterns so that we can change them enabling us to feel secure and to seek out satisfying companionship
"intimate, not together, not there, son",You didnt ask a direct question because I feel from what you wrote you already know the answer  I hate to sound harsh but I am a therapist that call it how I see it so brace yourselfYou will always continue to have problems with letting your childs father go as long as youDont love or respect yourself firstDont love and respect your sonDont demand respect as a woman and motherGive up the goods regardless of what he does for you or your sonDont hold your son as a priority in your lifeHave self worth of a 1 etcI have a feeling you are sayingI do love my son and hold him as a priority even if you dont do it for yourselfI would askAre your actions of allowing such disrespect from his father proof of thatI know what I have said may have gotten under your skinI want it to because I feel that you have a conscience want to do better know you and your son deserve better and you can do better  Believe in yourself and that you and your son DO desire better and it starts with you setting boundaries with his father  You can do  it
"emotions, symptoms, situations, never loved, divorce, abandoned, financial help, angry, mean, fault, not compatible",Its hard to say that it is a midlife crisis stage  could be but so much more seems to be going on or have been going on to say with confidence that it is not much more
"negative words, hurt, moved out, seeing a counselor, wants another chance, make things right, trust, old ways",I am glad he is seeing a counselor  That is something that most men struggle with doing at times  Time will tell if his actions are of good intentions  However remember that a person can only do to you what you allow them to do in relationships   What part did you play  Did you down play his disrespect at one time  Did you give up the power of your own voice  Did you lose yourself in the relationship and it became just one sided  Did you allow him to make you doubt yourself   In others words if you do decide to give him another chance what would you do different  Not saying that you are the blame or cause of the negative words AT ALL but dont allow such disrespect from him or anyone else in the future  If you do decide to give it another try go in with a voice with the demand of respect with your needs and wants expressed and expected  With an increase in your self worth and confidence you will know what to do if his actions are true or if with dishonest intentions   Seek counseling as well if you need that additional support to find self
"exboyfriend, affair, pregnancies, abortion, miscarriage, contact, wants me back, nothing to offer",Hi AtticaThis is a question I think a lot of people deal withthey feel confusion about why they cant forget about or get over or stop connecting with someone who they absolutely know isnt good for them In your case part of the problem is that he keeps trying to get back in touch with you For some people honestly its a game to see how much power they have over you or its their need to control you If you dont want contact from this person its really important to give him clear messages about boundaries Dont contact me again and then ignore all of their communications Any interactions or responses from you at all will feed their behaviour Remind yourself why you dont want to be with them I hear you doing that already when you say he has nothing to offer me Thats great selftalkBut lets get back to the question of why we have a hard time letting go of people like this Sometimes its because we still hope they will change Maybe we remember who they used to be or how they used to treat us and we think it can go back to the way it felt in those good old days The problem there is that over the first few years as intimacy grows people tend to show more of who they are not less So what theyre eventually showing you is who they are and what theyre capable of People do change and grow but it wont happen at your pace Accept that person for who they are and stop expecting them to change Another reason we cant let go is because we picture our ex with someone new in the future and we wonder if they will be a better person for the next partner in their life This is a normal but not a healthy thought Its as though we want them to stay maybe apologize and heal our hurts maybe make up for past mistakes You deserve that healing you deserve better than you got you deserve apologies but to expect that from the person who hurt you and hasnt demonstrated that compassion as yet is probably foolhardy It is my belief that underlying some of the above scenarios is the deep belief that we must somehow be responsible for the hurts our exes have caused If you blame yourself in any way for someones poor treatment of you you will be dancing around trying to do things differently so that they can treat you better It will be impossible to let go because you blame yourself for their behavioursDraw a line Their behaviours are about them not you and the only solution is to challenge and reduce thoughts of them and create physical and emotional distance These things plus time will help the events of the past fade from importance
"huge dispute, divorce, left, come home, see kids, not filed, marriage",In any relationship including marriage each partner will be better able to do their part by understanding their own interests and wishesConcentrate more on what youd like from your marriage  This will naturally raise the questions and criteria of what to talk with your husband about and what to ask of himThink over whether you wish to divorce or notSince he hasnt taken any action then for the moment you can assume he is not sure of what he wantsOnce you feel a little more clear on your opinion about your marriage including feeling uncertain if youd like it to end or continue then you will be able to tell your husband the suggestions you have for resolving the dispute matter and emotionsTry to redirect your speculations about what does he want I wonder what hes thinking back to answering these very reasonable questions about yourselfThis will strengthen your own purpose in clarifying where to start and guide a discussion with himGood luck
"former husband, separated, sexually, sleeping with others, marriage, saved, part ways, care deeply, seeing someone else, try to do so",Sorry to hear about the stress in your relationship  There is definite value in being clear as you are about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriageAlso positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you or notWhether your marriage can be saved depends on what each person is willing to accept about the other oneIs sleeping with other women the only criterion of what will satisfy you about being together with your husbandLove and care are not enough to make a marriage work Partners need to be able to compromise and cooperate with each other That you care for him definitely intensifies any emotion you feel toward your husband  It intensifies any frustration and sadness about the relationship tooDecide how much emotional sadness and hurt youre willing to tolerate and the reason youre willing to do soFrom what you write you are being very generous of yourself and not being reciprocated for thisIf your husband doesnt start taking steps toward satisfying your wishes this may be your time to question your own generosity in waiting for him to do so

"divorce, sudden, ups and downs, fight, family, daughter, wife",Chances are if you really think about it there were signs that something wasnt quite right in your marriage You may have passed these things off as being the normal ups and downs of a marriage but whatever it was or wasnt its obviously bothering your wife I would say yes keep trying to fight for your family at least until you know what the problems are from your wifes perspective and if theyre repairable Ask your wife if shes willing to try to work on the marriage and then see a marriage counselor Just be sure youre open to hearing whats said and try not to get defensive if she blames you for some thingsEven if your wife is adamant about getting a divorce that doesnt mean youre divorcing your daughter and you should make sure she knows that Continue to be a part of her life And although it may be difficult if a divorce does happen try to be as amicable as possible with your wife so your daughter isnt further impacted by this new family dynamic
"divorce, narcissistic sociopath, emotionally abusing, moved, giving up, coping, normal, healthy, cruelty, not adapt, strong, astounded, doesn't care, feel like I don't exist, no contact, losing faith, humanity",I am very sorry to hear of your struggles I think that it is normal to struggle to get your feet under you again after a divorce especially after leaving a relationship that lasted 11 years so try not to be too hard on yourself Take it one day at a time and do the best you canI notice that you said he left you This tells me that you didnt have the strength to leave him on your own despite the fact that you say he was emotionally and mentally abusive and also cheating on you Low selfesteem can keep someone in a bad relationship because they think they cant do any better Also abusers will make you think that they are the best thing you can get The way I see it he did you a favor You are now free to make your own life whatever you want it to be Take this time alone to work on you As hurtful as it may be that other people dont want to help you this is something that you need to do for yourself without feeling like you need someone in your life to take care of you Your statement I dont feel like I exist anymore tells me that in addition to low selfesteem you also dont have a clear sense of identify and rely on the people in your life to help define who you are People can and will let you down It is important for you to learn to handle disappointment learn to take care of your own needs and to gain a stronger sense of self Do nice things for yourself every day because you deserve it Even if it is just to soak a little longer in a hot bubble bath do something that makes you feel good Find a hobby that you enjoy Look in the mirror and tell yourself some positive affirmations daily Google positive affirmations to find some that resonate with you Such statements might be I am a good person who deserves to be happy or I can do this Some relaxation and meditation exercises may help you as well There are some free meditation exercises that you can find online by doing a simple Google searchTake this time to focus on you and try not to worry about what everyone else in your life is doing When you are a happier more stable person the right people will come into your life without you even looking for them Good luck with rebuilding your life I know it is hard Remember to take it one day at a time
"conflicted, crush, flirting, made out, hoping, distanced",Hello Emotions run high in crush situations and when emotions run high its not uncommon for us to have emotionbased instead of factbased thoughts After reading your question I wondered how you went from making out to nothing happened I wondered if this happened because of an emotionbased thought that sounded like If he liked me he would make something happen A truer and more empowering thought might be I want something different to happen with him and I want to take a different action to see if that can happen This thought focuses more on the one thing you can control YOU  Hopefully the thought also empowers you to think through what you can do to gauge interesttalk with him about his feelings on the matter I hope this helps and good luck to you
"wrong, inappropriate content, respect beliefs, mad, friend, send, video",The offspring are your PropertyIf you require that no other man show inappropriate content to them then require compensation for use and enjoyment of your Property without your consentSend them a billWhen they do not pay it activate the local Sheriff take them to small claims court and win a judgment against them for failure to compensate for the use and enjoyment of your PropertyI wonder what might happen after that learn to act as man  and watch the magic happen
"concerned, doubts, feedback, assured, customer service, deficient, codependent",This interaction with your boss seems strange It is tricky to know how to handle workplace conflicts but there are typically resources in place to help employees and mangers communicate successful and feel confident that they are being treated fairly at work Is there an HR department that you can use as a mediator
"high stress position, overworked, underpaid, anxiety, demoralizing, manage stress",I think its important to tease more of this situation out to figure out what is at the root of the stress It is emotionally dangerous to be at a job for a lengthy duration in which you feel overworked and underpaid You will not perform well as you mention and thus your selfesteem will continually take a hit without really any effort So I dont know that simply coping with your stress would be advisable as a first stepYou dont speak about a lot of what the office dynamics are like which can be a big indicator for me of what can be done to help you feel better because we exist as a part of a relationship with everything including people at our job I would encourage you to speak up about your contributions to your boss Often overworked and underpaid also includes the my boss never notices me and that can demoralizing If we feel appreciated that can go a long way Ive found that it is quite common for bosses to require some instruction for how to show each of their employees appreciation and it goes deeper than thank you or taking you out to lunch  its almost something felt as opposed to made explicitBut sometimes appreciation isnt going to do the trick either Because that overworked and underpaid actually has led you to feel burnout You have zero interest in doing the job in the way it is designed so some real changes need to be implemented The bottom line Try not to just suck it up and do all of the self care work on your own If your company isnt helping you to take care of yourself Im talking to you boss that handles employee pay andor work conditions then you also have to question if this is a company worth working for While I dont know exactly what you do it sounds like you have confidence in your contributions So take that confidence to a tech company that will support you and there are tech companies out there
"suppressing, can't make eye contact, driving me crazy, vague discussion, personalized gift, dating someone",There are many possible ways dating your boss could go awry and jeopardize your occupational wellbeing so my recommendation is to hold off on presenting your boss with a personalized gift and instead focus on building attraction and romantic interest with someone who is not at the workplace  Sometimes the element of power and unavailability can heighten our sexual interest but that doesnt mean its a healthy idea to pursue someone who is in a position of power over you at your workplace
"accusing of cheating, disrespectful behavior, offended, accused of cheating, misunderstanding, trying to understand",Hello That must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault This could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the longterm Based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wifes side of the story I would say that you are raising 3 different concerns One is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified It may bear clarifying how each of you define infidelity Currently there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hookup chatroom texting extensive phone calls to a female friend viewing pornography a massage with happy ending physical intercourse or intimate emotional sharing Depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities If there is no truth to it then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying I feel you distancing from me In other words its not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her Often times accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness If so what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally If this is true you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again Otherwise if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs The second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a sweetheart The term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean youre so sweet and kind my dear or in a flirtatious manner to mean sweetie The intention behind the use is known only to the speaker You may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife If your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said  If she finds the term disrespectful it may be her way of expressing I want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that I am not valued as much Therefore arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark Rather the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings You may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you Is saying sweetheart to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife That said if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding accomodating and prioritizing her needs then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities She may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fearsThe last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting shes wrong Indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong In the absence of her admitting to any faults it could seem like you are the one with the problem Unfortunately blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy This pattern can also trigger the partners insecurity as they witnesses the distancing which could make them angrier and more accusatory  creating a vicious cycle Finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment This kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding We sometimes take for granted the simple expression of Im sorry However it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that In my practice when a client tells me that his or her partner never says Im sorry I am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability If neither of them express it then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesnt do it These insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating For more information about these services you are

"emotions, lied, reimbursement, hotel room, paycheck, out of town, texted, rent, late, jobs",Hello and thank you for your question It really is up to you to decide if you owe him the 2500 If you feel like it is the right thing to do based on your discussion with him then pay when you can I am actually much more concerned with how he is treating you over 2500 I know that it can be a lot of money if you dont have much but that doesnt give someone the right to call you names and harass you through texts You may want to take some time and think about your relationship and make sure that these are the qualities and behaviors you want in a sexual partner Be wellRobin J Landwehr DBH LPCC NCC
"teenager, first job, boss, pushed, cry, restroom, talk, tear, hate, keep me",Getting your first job is an exciting terrifying and challenging experience It is something you will remember for a long time and it shapes how you begin to think about yourself as a worker You are literally learning as you go in this completely new environment You are going to make mistakes You are not going to get it right the first time It can be even more challenging if you are having a difficult time building relationships that are supportive at work A couple of things to remember here 1 You are there to do a job and you are getting paid to do it 2 There is a reason or reasons for you wanting to be there and do that work 3 you know best what you need in order to be successful These three items can be helpful to remember especially when we feel our emotions are taking over in a place where we do not feel safe to express them fully If you feel like your supervisor is approachable meaning someone you could talk to because they express confidence in you let them know you are nervous about doing a good job Also let them know how you learn new tasks information or expectations so they can deliver the message in a way that you understand Becoming a successful worker doesnt happen overnight but each day you can identify what works for you and what doesnt by communicating with your work team the easier it will be for you We all had a first job once and were all worried about doing well Hang in there and call a counselor if you need more help
"mood swings, false statements, proof, employer, therapist",If this is a concern of a few coworkers make sure it is not something they see but you dont admit to  Employers can suggest or something stipulate in continued employment with them  for you to go to their Employment Assistance Provider EAP if they have noticed the same behavior and concerned of how it is effecting productivity or employee relationships  No one wants to work in a environment which they consider hostile  Employers can be held responsible if they do not take actionCouple of things you can doAsk a coworker in which you trust and respect if what others are saying is trueSeek professional help from your primary care provider or counselor if mood swings do exist
"attracted, dear friend, relationship problems, family dreams, flirtation, making out, keep it quiet, hoped, not over it, maintain the friendship, feelings, constantly touching, drawn to him, fantasizing, not interested, checking me out, get him out of my system, maintain the friendship",It sounds like you have mixed feelings and motivations  which is understandable On the one hand you want to get over him on the other you are still holding out hope for something more It will be really hard to let go of him and create friend boundaries so long as there is a part of you holding on to the idea of something more If you are being really honest with yourself you might need to acknowledge that you are not really striving to get him out of your system  that you have not really given up hope of having a relationship with him If you are wholeheartedly committed to moving past the sexual and romantic parts of your relationship and just having a friendship than refraining from all the touching would be a good place to start It is hard to just be friends when all your sex and bonding hormones are coursing through your veins
"ethical codes, legal ramifications",Generally the ethical codes only prohibit relationships with clients There are however a few types of counselortocounselor relationships that are prohibited by the ethics codes Such prohibited relationships include those between supervisors and supervisees between professors and students or any time the relationship might negatively impact your or their clients Lastly some workplaces have rules against dating coworkers It would be a good idea to check if there is such a rule that applies to you
"confusion, uncertainty, self-identity crisis",What exactly is it that you are looking for Different people define themselves in different ways For example one person may define himself by his values and morals while another identifies herself by her personality and characteristics Still another person may define himself by his interests and hobbies Learning who you are as a person can take time and life experience At the same time who you are may change according to what experiences you have had and how you have dealt with them or felt about them Try viewing the journey of finding yourself as exciting and ongoing Allow yourself to feel emotions and learn how they relate to the experiences you have This may help you to know more about what you value what you like and dislike and what you want for yourself in life Best of luck to you
"born a girl, want to be a boy, religion, cant tell family, wont accept, What do I do","I understand that this must be a difficult time for you with
many adjustments If you feel comfortable enough to ask your parents to see a
Life Coach or a therapist this may be an excellent place to start You dont
need to tell them the reason why maybe say that you simply need someone to talk
to for support with school or homework etc The Life Coach or therapist would
be the optimal person to advise you on how to proceed with providing support
and guidance There may be someone at your school whom you could talk to for
confidential support and guidance as well Be confident in the fact that you
are not alone and there are always responsible adults available to guide you
through any difficult process you may experience in life Talking to family
about personal issues can be difficult for anyone even adults I recommend
getting help from a trusted professional adult before you decide what to do"
"strong Christian background, went off the straight and narrow, hard time accepting, not a virgin, insecurities, hurting our relationship, let go of my past, live in the present",For you and your fiance to move past this he needs to accept you just the way you are  Being that you mentioned that you both come from a Christian background maybe you could start there he needs to forgive and trust your love for him  His insecurities stem from something bigger than you not being a virgin  Since this is the man you are willing to spend the rest of your life with be patient and help him find the help he needs  Talk about your commitment to him and reassure him that your history does not have to affect your relationship  Lastly PreMarital Counseling can help you and him to open up about other things that might affect the marriage laterGod Bless You Both Mirella
"stupid question, dont know, real, lying, God, lies",There are an infinite number of ways to look at this Spirituality religion God higher power and many other parts of this discussion mean different things to different people My question for you is what does real actually mean to you Often the concept of God has to do with what you believe in If you ask 1000 different people youll probably get almost that many different answersConsider talking with friends or family about this I would suggest though that you have the discussion initially with people who you trust and who you feel are willing to listen to your questions and beliefs and perhaps offer an opinion without trying to make you believe as they do You may also consider speaking with a pastor or another religious figure The local Salvation Army may have a link to a religious or spiritual person that leads nondenominational church services There may be able to help you to sort through this if your friends and family do not provide a comfortable environment for you related to this discussionJust a word of caution In my experience ideas of religion and spirituality can be lead to very deep discussions with some people who are very strongly connected to what they believe Some people do not easily separate their own beliefs from those of others When initiating conversations about this try first asking whether someone would be comfortable discussing religion or spirituality A second question may be whether it is okay with this person you are talking to if you have different beliefs or opinionsAs far as whether God is real or not consider trusting yourself and what you learn feel and believe as you work through this process
"lost my virginity, sexual manner, tempted, led him on, have sex, dreaming of a potential future together, incredibly happy, escape from abusive relationships, love him very much",Having sex with your boyfriend is and was a mistake Mistakes can be forgiven and you can make amendsBut it is not the end of your relationship or Gods will for youHave a serious talk with your guy and get back on track with where you want to be Talk to a counselor or your priestpastor Get someone to be your guide and mentor Check in with them regularlyGetting back to square one could actually strengthen your relationshipHave a plan for the future where you will not be put into a place of temptation Group dates public places and no alone time where temptations might ariseForgive yourself and move on
"true identity, guilty, religious, boyfriend, sexual acts, parents, Christian, messages, aggravated, break up, school, brainwashed, yelling, stuck, track, support, slut, devil worshipper, separate life, adopted.",What a tough situation you must be in feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you I would say the first thing you want to do is if you havent already have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents telling them how you feel and letting them know what you need from them If communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward You unfortunately will not be able to change your parents feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the relationship you have with your parents It always helps to try and see things from another angle You might want to for example try and understand your parents perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset Validating others feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively Are you living with your parents and do they support you If so are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follow their rules Know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply Your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper Not everyone will always approve of the choices we make and sometimes we need to be okay with that Best of luck to you
"family gatherings, funerals, different customs",I think the best thing you can do is be respectful of each family members wishes Although everyone may not agree with one another the most important thing you can do for each other is to respect their faith and beliefs instead of trying to sway them in a certain direction There are many families that are united despite their differences For example a mother may be Catholic and the father Jewish By introducing the children to each faith until they are ready to decide for themselves can be beneficial Also its not uncommon for views to change as one ages or faces different life experiences So dont get too discouraged if your child wants to explore different avenues Creating a loving and accepting environment is most essential
"issues from my past, heavily burdened, torn, trauma, come out, holding me back, happiness, loving and caring man, pushing him away, get my life back",You already are doing that You are reaching out virtually still counts You are accepting your past you are not denying what happened to you you are talking about the past You are already doing a great job of starting this journey You get your life back by doing things differentlyI would think about how you would like to process your past Do you want to talk to someone Do you want to write about it Do you want to pray about it Do you want to read and research books about trauma Take some time and think about what you want to do Think about what would work for you and dive in I am a Licensed Professional Counselor so I am biased  but I really believe that counseling works Having an objective professional voice that can guide you on this process is so valuable But please choose what makes you feel comfortable  not what everyone else says I think you are very brave for reaching out and wanting to work on this That takes a tremendous amount of courage and strength
"raped, trouble feeling emotions, sociopath, lacking feeling, change",HiThis is a great questionThe term you are looking for is alexithymia the inability to identify and describe emotions in the self However just because you are not able to feel or express emotions does not mean that you do not have emotionsAfter such a traumatic event that you experienced your central nervous system goes into defensive mode dorsal vagal nerves that protect you from any further harm What this means is if you were to feel your emotions related to your rape you would have a sense of being overwhelmed possibly reexperiencing the traumatic eventNot feeling emotions is your bodys way of protecting you from any further trauma Unfortunately when the parasympathetic dorsal vagal system shutting down feeling is activated and suppresses your painful emotions pain shame guilt sadness anger it also shuts down your positive and relational emotions love joy contentment connectedness happinessI am very sorry that you had to go through such a traumatic experience as being raped No one knows what is going on inside of you as a result You dont know what is happening to your emotional wellbeing The best and at times difficult and scary thing is to process your emotions related to your trauma This processing is done carefully with a trained counselor in a place that you feel safe heard and not judged Although the thought of proceedings addressing emotions may be anxietyinducing it brings on a huge sense of relief and validationWhat you are going through is normal considering what happened to you I hope you reach out for more helpIf you have any questions feel free to contact me Catherine at clevelandemotionalhealthcom
"posttraumatic stress disorder, military experiences, car accident, diagnosed, problems, experiences",You are right on to recognize that the effects of trauma can be cumulative  It is very possible that a car accident could lead to an increase in PTSD symptoms that were related to other traumatic experiencesIf you have been deployed to a combat area you are most likely eligible for free counseling services through the VA Vet Centers  The Vet Center clinicians typically have a lot of experience working with military trauma Heres a link to a directory of Vet CentershttpwwwvagovdirectoryguidevetcenteraspYour service and sacrifice is greatly appreciated
"PTSD, side effects, impacts on sex, anger, relationships, lost job, get my life back",This is a great question PTSD can be very complex and debilitating It must be very difficult for you at this timeWhen we feel complex emotions such as anger frustration and possibly lowself worth the tendency is to try to avoid or suppress these emotions The more you avoid them the more these emotions will express themselves and at the worst times This may be why your PTSD symptoms are harming your relationships and your job statusTo help you get your life back it is important to process your emotions with a counselor that has specific training in traumainformed interventions To process emotions you start by inviting them in observe them with compassion and without judgment When we observe our emotions it starts the healing process because we separate ourselves from them Remember thoughts and emotions are constructed You are not your thoughts nor your emotions They are messengers telling you to pay attention to them The more we avoid the messengers the louder they get to the point that they are crippling you in more than one wayI hope this helps you begin your change process For more information please here is a link to a trauma post on my blog The Wisdom RoomPlease reach out for help And contact me with any questionsSincerely Catherine ClevelandCleveland Emotional Health

"abused as a child, hug, touch, feels, being abused, girlfriend, situation",Was your gf always this way with you or did her withdrawal develop suddenlyAlso are there any other changes going on between the two of you in terms of feeling relaxed and at ease with each other enjoying each otherIts possible her physical withdrawal due to her sensitive nature about who touches her and the meaning of touch reflects an underlying emotional hesitation about her feelings toward youThis can be either strong positive or negative feelingsShe may be fearful of becoming more intimately attached to you and withdrawsShe may be actually withdrawing and expresses herself through the amount of touch she wants from othersBest way forward as almost always in a relationship is to have a gentle conversation to open up the tension between the two of you
"lost a friend to suicide, smoking marijuana, drinking more, cope with it, handle this better",Suicide is not a natural way to pass from this Earth so many times it can be EXTREMELY tough to deal with because of the unnaturalness of the event We may find ourselves feeling guilty that we did not see it or that we couldve have done more or something to stop it but often the fish in the fishbowl cannot see that which is closest to him You are currently trying to numb your feelings those feelings as nasty as they are are meant to be felt those feelings help us to process the event and also help us to pass through the situation Your friend has a legacy remember it and honor that legacy everyday in some small or even grand way perhaps committing or volunteering your time to help others in honor of your friendHope this helps C
"family issues, violent, cheater",Sorry that your growing up years in the family were so unsafe and painfulEveryone has family legacy patterns of behavior and ways of handling emotions handed down to them simply by livingAll of what any child observes and how they are treated within their family context creates their foundational expectations of othersThe best way of releasing yourself form hurtful interaction patterns is by being aware of your own feelings and intuition within close relationshipsIf you have a similar sense of hurt or that something is wrong yet in a familiar way then most likely you are in a relational pattern similar to the negative ones in your family of originThis realization moment is your chance to more deeply see your own original trauma and try different ways of responding to these similar key situationsThis type of work takes a lot of repeated effort because trauma is deep and childhood trauma is attached to loving ones parentsExpect slow progress and expect more than a few tearsIf it feels overwhelming then a therapist for guidance and support would be very beneficial to the work youd be doing within yourselfSending lots of good luck
"mentally abused, cant function properly, letting go of the past, terrified, getting better, trauma, never gotten to be myself",I am so sorry to hear that you are struggling  Getting to know yourself after a trauma especially at the hands of a caregiver and learning to trust yourself can feel terrifying  I would encourage you to seek out a trauma therapist who can work with you slowly and at your pace  You are not your trauma  You are good and you are whole  Please seek out the support of a therapist who sees that in you
"terrible sex life, fear of pain during sex, partners who weren't careful, projecting onto current boyfriend",Without knowing much about your situation I would encourage you to seek out either a sex therapist who is traumainformed or a trauma therapist who has knowledge about sexual concerns  Even consensual sex can be experienced as an intrusion if a partner was not careful or insensitive to your pain  It would be normal to have some difficulties with sex after such an incident
"sick, felt sick, wanted to go home, touching me, able to leave",I am so sorry that this happened to you and am so glad that you were able to get away  Your body is yours and yours alone  I would highly recommend that you find a therapist who specializes in treating trauma in order to help you to heal from your ordeal

"glad, best decision, nightmares, flashbacks, creating a wall, current relationship",Ending an abusive relationship is often very difficult especially if you were very close initially without the presence of abuse  If the abuse included verbal or psychological condemnation you will often have a negative selfimage that you may know is not true but often feels very true This negative selfimage and fear of being abused again can activate protections in you that were needed at the time you were abused but now create a wall in your current relationship  The fact that you were able to end the relationship and know that you made the right decision is a great acknowledgement that you have solid internal resources to draw upon in healing from the abuse  Good for youNightmares and flashbacks are a strong sign of memories including associated beliefs emotions and physical sensations that have remained unprocessed and therefore unhealed  There are likely reminders called triggers of the past abuse that are being activated in your current relationship that are allowing these unhealed memories to come to the surface and affect both your sleep and your waking experiences  This is certainly not something you are purposefully doing but is the result of what happened to you  However you likely feel as if you are not in control    The goal is protect your current relationship evaluate your selfimage for flaws in beliefs and feelings and begin working on healing your memories of abuse In many cases my use of EMDR Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing would be helpful in reducing the emotional strength of your abuse memories reduce or eliminate triggers bring healing and allow you to enjoy being in the present with your current relationship  I would recommend discussing with your current partner your harmful past experiences your decision to pursue counseling and your strong desire to be healthy for your current relationship  With a good support network in place healing is very possible
"victim of an incident, made fun of, beating myself up, dont feel anyone believes me, daily basis, ignore my problems, scary when Im alone",As you seemed to have learned the impact will not just go away Treatment of trauma is like surgery it requires a skillful clinician to help resolve it While you are contemplating getting help you can focus on calming techniques like meditation and yoga They will aid you when you begin the therapeutic process
"molested as a child, no memory",Im not sure that I have the answer to your question but I can tell you that it would be helpful to talk with a certified hypnotist There are a list of them here httpwwwnatboardcomindexfilesPage548htm You also may want to talk to someone who specializes in EMDR This stands for Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing and it is a specific trauma treatment I am not trained in this particular method but my understanding is that it does not require a lot of knowledge of the origin of the trauma before being started
"flashback, past trauma, hysterically crying, freaking out, hurt",Have you sought the support of a therapist really qualified in working through sexual trauma It can take some work but healing is possible If you feel able to it may also help to open a dialogue with your boyfriend about what you need from him when you have these flashbacks Let him know what some helpful responses may be

"father told me, real dad, getting along, teenager, degraded, love you, hugs, horrible names, evil man, no feelings",Hi Louisiana You got it righthes supposed to be your father Its tough enough being adopted unless Im reading it wrong I think youre adopted what you dont need is to be verbally abused by someone whos supposed to love and protect you I dont know how old you are past teen years though or where your mom is but I bet there are other people in your life who treat you differently Its your right to spend your time with the people who love you properly Thats a really important part of learning how to be happycarefully choosing whos going to be in your life Its tricky to put emotional distance between you and your supposedtobe father but its possiblephysical distance avoid him if you dont trust youll be treated with respect and emotional distance feeling less connected to and affected by his relationship disability I think youre already doing that part because you dont blame yourself for his words which is wonderful I dont know if hes evil although I believe evil exists but he may be incapable of loving properly or lacking empathy as you suggest A good therapist can support you in these goals I wish you the best in your growth as an independent adult
"therapy, childhood issues, kids, exwife, unable to see",Probably the more important questions to answer concern how much confidence you have in you and your boyfriend becoming parents how you each feel about the influence of his being banned from seeing his current children and be clear about the circumstances that led up to the decision of him not being permitted to see his kidsDont allow some random professional to pronounce your boyfriend as cured  A relatively qualified therapist would never make this callPsychological and emotional tensions emerge from our relationships within families  You and your boyfriend are in a position to set a strong foundation for having children assuming each of you wants childrenChildhood issues your boyfriends anyones are more likely to go away when new patterns of interacting emergeIf the two of you are engaged in setting a secure relationship as future parents the disappointments and hurt from the very early years will be replaced by better ways of interacting
"implanting thoughts, nightmare, lost my kids, lost my job, unwilling participant, no longer trust, afraid, hypnosis",Given your experience of being imposed upon against your will and all the personal and professional loss that has come since your fear of what will happen if you undergo treatment and trust a therapist is understandable There is no technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away or be reversed however there are things that you can do which may help you to change your relationship to the thoughts and to the distress that they cause I understand that working with a therapist sounds risky given your experiences and at the same time a good therapist may be a beneficial resource in helping you deal with the intrusive thoughts cope with and alleviate the stress that they create and perhaps even lead to the alleviation of the thoughts themselves A therapist may also be able to help you discover strategies to work towards any goals you have around reconnecting with your children and working again If therapy feels too unsafe at the moment I would recommend looking into workbooks on how to deal with intrusive thoughts and coping with stress Some popular approaches that you may want to look into are mindfulness techniques Acceptance and Commitment Therapy or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy You may even be able to find some of these resources at a library if affordability is an obstacle
"horrible sexual things, regret, cope with myself, remember my past",Im very sorry to hear this Hypnosis can be a valuable tool that a trained therapist can use to bring back suppressed memories However keep in mind that hypnosis doesnt work for everyone I think regardless speaking with a therapist about your sexual issues would be beneficial It seems like you have experienced some painful experiences in the past and may need help dealing with them in order to move forward In addition if past memories do resurface a trained therapist will be able to help you cope with them as they arise I wish you the best of luck and I hope you receive the treatment that you deserve

"survivor of domestic violence, past relationship, horrible nightmares, wake up in sweat, dreams feel so real",Nightmare are actually very common for survivors of domestic violence If they are affecting you the the point where you feel like you need to do something you may want to consider processing your memories of the events with a trained trauma therapist Another good option may be to attend a support group for survivors where you could process your memories in a safe space where others will be able to provide support and understanding for what you went through as well as encouragement for the strength it took you to get out of that relationship You may also want to consider completing a screening or assessment to rule out posttraumatic stress disorder as well
"domestic abuse situation, therapist, borderline personality disorder, assessment, abuser, test results",It sounds like it may have been a violation of confidentiality for your therapist to disclose information about you without your permission  There are some exceptions to the general rule of confidentiality however  For example when a therapist has a reasonable concern that a client or someone else is in imminent danger he or she is generally allowed to disclose confidential information to protect that personIf you believe your counselor has violated your confidentiality you can always contact your states counseling regulatiory board  The board will then investigate the allegations and can take appropriate action
"lying, problem, stupid stuff, accident, afraid, cold shoulder, mad, ignores, verbally abusive, emotionally abusive, bad things, awful names, tired of crying, call it quits, toddler",Hi Texas Thanks for your honesty it helps me know where to go in answering you What strikes me in your question is that you describe several ways in which your husband is hurtfulabusivecontrolling with you and then you ask Should we call it quits We I wonder if maybe the first step is for you to start seeing this decision as yours rather than yours together The way your husband treats you is not your fault Texas Your lies are a natural and normal way of you avoiding situations and encounters that feel unsafe for you The problem is not your lying The problem is that you dont feel safe enough to be honest with a person youre supposed to be able to trustTheres an analogy that I sometimes use I dont know if this is scientifically true or simply a useful story but its powerful either way so I will tell it to youIf you take a frog and drop it into a pot of boiling water the frog will jump out immediately knowing instinctively that if it stays in the pot it will die If you take a frog however and put it in a pot of cold water and slowly slowly heat it to boiling the frog will boil to death because it will fail to recognise the moment when it no longer has the energy to jump out of the pot by the time it realises its dying it has lost its strength Its called learned helplessness When your power or your voice has been taken away for a long time you get used to that and you fail to see the options that are available to you You have a toddler and you may be under the impression that staying in the marriage is best for the child In my experience and what research backs up is that children first and foremost need a safe environment and parents who are happy You are likely underestimating the effects on your child of living in a home with woman abuse This is a complex picture and if you were my client I would want to get you to a stronger place emotionally where youre seeing the situation clearly and gathering resources and supports before you make any big decisions but I do see that there are decisions that are there for you to make that can lead to a happy life for you and your child I sincerely hope you seek professional help with either a shelter for abused women or a therapist I wish you the best
"emotions, deep connection, kicked out, hard, cheap hotels, dropped out of school, sleep in the car, arguing, violence, frightened, challenged, hurts me, courage, damaged, apologizes, domestic violence, tables turned, hope",Hi Winters I learned a long time ago that I cant ever predict who will change and who wont I meet couples who seem to have all the ingredients but cant make it work and others who have severe issues and they decide to make better decisions and things change But in reading your story the image of a slot machine came to mind Youre gambling your life away on the chance that this guy will change Only you can decide how many years to give it I see him giving you clear signs that he doesnt even believe in himself or want to change though What are you waiting forAlthough you say you know his behaviours arent your fault something tells me that youre hoping your love for him will turn the key that unlocks something and makes him want to change It doesnt work that way Just like the slot machine you have no power to change him or make this work You can only decide when youve paid too much I bet theres someone out there who loves and misses you Hes not your only support
"anger issues, worsened, never dealt with emotions, expressed physically, endure episodes, lose her, throw things, hit her, physically lash out, lesbian, early 30s, childhood, ready to change, need help, about to explode",Hi Baton RougeIm glad youre reaching out The first step here is that you are taking some responsibility for your behaviours I do hear you minimizing your actions you say you dont hit her enough to cause harm but youre headed in the right direction I hope that in your pursuit of treatment you learn that the harm youre causing isnt just superficial bruising The effects of using aggression and anger to control a person are deep and lasting wounds Please seek treatment for yourself immediatelyYou say you love your girlfriend Do you love her enough to leave the relationship while you address your issues Are you brave enough to not lean on this relationship while you learn how to create a safe place for a partnerYou have dangerous habits because you dont know how to manage your own emotional pain You can unlearn this and it doesnt mean youre a bad person Sometimes however the relationship in which you have done the hurting is best ended for both of your sakes because too much damage has been doneI know you dont want to lose her but you dont own her and you dont have the right to trap her in this because youre afraid of being alone Right now she needs some space to figure out whats best for her and the freedom to make whatever decision she wants This is potentially the first step to learning real respect honouring her need for safety above your need for comfort I wish you well
"cheated on, pregnant, physically abusive, mentally abusive, attempted to talk, blames me, help him, discredits me, hurtful, crying, feeling lonely, unhappy, unsure",That sounds like a very hurtful situation Unfortunately without a batterers intervention course or a desire to change the abuse cycle is unlikely to stop I do not recommend that you try to leave on your own due that being the most dangerous time when in an abusive relationship As an abuser his goal is to control you whether its through mental or verbal means I recommend that you contact a domestic violence shelter in your area I have worked closely with Harbor House of Central Florida and know they provide housing transportation and any other needed resources to women leaving an abusive relationship There is help out there and you are not alone If you need any additional resources in your area please dont hesitate to contact me
"child with my baby mother, young son, cheating, putting me down, doesn't love me, fight, raped by a family member, hard time, family, annoying, belittles me, work, watch the baby, days off, cooks, cleans, friends, confiding to some guy, leave",It sounds like you are in a tough situation You have to ask yourself why you dont want to leave her Is it because of the child Or is it because you want the relationship to work You must consider that being in an abusive relationship is not healthy for you or your child So if the abuse continues it would be more beneficial for you and your child to move outOn the other hand if you are just wanting the relationship to work out despite its current state you need to evaluate whether the relationship is worth salvaging It seems as though you are very unhappy and undervalued in this relationship Although your question revealed just a short bit of information I didnt read about any positives in the relationship Sometimes its extremely hard to leave a relationship even though you know that the relationship itself is harmful for you However with time and focus you can do it Each day will get a little easier and you have to trust yourself that you are making the right situation for you and your childHowever if you really feel that you want to stay in the relationship you have to be upfront with her You need to tell her exactly how you feel and give her specific examples of how she is hurting you This gives her a chance to render the situation If after this there is no improvement I suggest that you start reconsidering your decision to stayI also think it would be valuable for you to start engaging in things outside of the home that make you happy Are there any hobbies you enjoy Are there any groups in the area that you can join such as playgroups that will allow you to engage with other parents Start looking into these options and finding an avenue for you to do something for your own benefitIt is certainly not healthy for you to isolate yourself from friends and family You need to have additional support networks besides the one with your girlfriend especially since this has not been a healthy environment latelyThank you for reaching out I wish you the best of luck with your relationship
"emotional hurt, arguments, broke up, make it work, pregnant, miscarriage, hurt, move back, relationship, see him, job, seeing other people, inappropriate pictures, confront, apologetic, mad, looking through his phone, closed car window, throw me out",There are plenty of red flags that you have been presented withSeveral breakups Not holding up his end of the bargain regarding workLack of empathy for your miscarriageLying about his involvement with another womanPhysical violence which is of most concern This seems to be a very unhealthy relationship In my experience relationships such as these rarely become positive ones Violence is never okay and regardless of his reasoning you looking through his phone it is indefensible You have to look at these red flags and ask yourself Is this really someone I want to marry Is he an asset to my life I think youll realize he is notBest of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you with kindness dignity and respect
"anger, trust issues, treat, fix, myself",I will assume that for whatever reason you either do not want to or are not able to seek counseling for this However I highly urge you to do so because longterm childhood abuse does have negative consequences for your life as an adult as it seems you are already aware There are confidential and free crisis hotlines that you can call that deal with sexual abuse Somemost also offer free counseling services in local areas That would be a good place to start looking especially if cost of counseling is an issueThe important thing to know is that what happened was not your fault and that you deserve to live a happy life free of the past Having anger and trust issues after something like this is a perfectly normal reaction to what happened to you Angry Yes At your brother for what he did at your parents for not protecting you Having trouble trusting Of course The very people who were supposed to love and protect you hurt you instead Two books that might help you are Codependent No More and Boundaries Where You End and I Begin
"snap easy, push people away, need help, push boyfriend away",Death of someone with whom we had fond involvement is sad   Accepting that a person is permanently gone from this earth is unsettling and can feel painfulThat you had no current contact with this person doesnt exclude the meaning or feelings from within your relationship with this person     Relationships dont require a time measurement in order to affect us   Your question acknowledges the process of adjusting to life without the chance to see or hear from this person againIt is normal to grieve so be gentle and not critical of yourself when you feel yourself missing this person
"unapologetic person, doesn't care, hurts, never apologizes, lose my temper, swear words, in front of my mom and brother",You must be feeling frustrated about how to resolve this Some people seem to really provoke emotional responses in us One thing to learn for a quick review of yourself when you are provoked is to pay attention to your body Notice your heart rate fists clenched some warmth going through your body and these are signs that the interaction is toxic for you Move out of the room say something calling to both of you and let things simmer down before responding When you are able to calm your body think of ways to bring the issue to her attention using positive words but holding your ground If she doesnt listen ask someone to come with you to talk to her about it If she still wont listen reassess your expectations of herFinally if you need to  you may have to consider changing the status of your rooming together
"angry, act out, scares, wife, child",Anger is a normal emotion no different than joy elation or sadness Its not anger that gets us in trouble its the overtness of the emotion or how we allow it to manifest that gets us in trouble Being able to control your temper depends on several variables how you saw anger acted out as a child in terms of your primary caregivers and what you internalized as being normal in terms of managing conflict and your communication style regarding how you confront problematic situations There are some whose anger takes on a volcano effect whereby they dont readily address problematic situations but rather they continue to stuff their emotion until the right trigger causes them them to explode and then there are those who are very impulsive in terms of how they react to stressful situations they dont take time to think out situations or to make sense of them they just impulsively respond I would encourage you to seek anger management from a therapist who utilizes a Cognitive Behavioral approach in order that you may explore how your irrational thinking related to certain situations may be influencing your problematic behavior In addition I would encourage you to engage in activities that promote stress reduction if your blowups are indeed related to being overly stressed The first step is recognizing that you have a problem that you need help in understanding and addressing which you have now take the next step in finding a therapist in order that you may learn to control your temper and undo some faulty wiring that may be related to how you process emotion and communicate that youre angry Remember anger is the overt expression of some other emotion ie disappointment hurt frustration etc Hope this helps
"losing a comb, furious, throwing things, problem",Anger does have its place  When anger is experienced often or the magnitude of it does not fit the scenario such as your losing comb the question becomes what does losing that comb mean to you  In the very split second that you have realized the comb is missing there is a reaction that occurs within you accompanied by an image or thought that like lightening flashes so quickly that you may not be aware what it is  As Sherry noted below awareness  Awareness is fundamental  Becoming aware of ourselves and what is happening internal that sparks it off  The next time you feel angry from a small thing stop and ask yourself why am I angry that this is lost  Find out what you are thinking or how you are speaking to yourself  You will become aware and once you are aware steps can be taken to alter the experience for the better A professional can assist with that
"relationship, boyfriend, drinks a lot, childhood trauma, violent outbursts, deal with",You shouldnt need to educate yourself on violent outbursts  He is the one in the position to change his violent outbursts   They are his behavior not yours  All youre trying to do is have a relationship with this guyThe one task to do is during a quiet time to tell your boyfriend the way you feel about his outburstsHis answer whether he denies having a problem blames you for his problem tells you the problem isnt so bad why are you complaining tells you a lot about his willingness to changeWhether or not he considers himself to have a problem and wants to change himself is very good for you to knowThis tells you what to expect from him in future   You can reflect and plan ahead for your own life depending on your tolerance and willingness to live with what he answers you
"heated, past brought up, raise my voice, point across, openended questions, turn my own answer against me, pregnant, drank in the past, not dependent on alcohol, social events",Have you tried to talk about the subjects of the past in the present at a time in which there is no heat between the two of youSince your gf would like to resolve situations from the past the best way to do so would be to talk about them  The more you try to avoid certain subjects the more likely they will come up between you at worse possible momentsIf you can get ahead of the pattern of old topics coming up without your control then try scheduling a discussion about them  This by itself will show your gf you care about what she cares about and this may be one quality she would feel good about
"argument, upset, hitting his face, scared, locked myself in the room",Sounds scary to watch  I agree with youMaybe he felt so overwhelmed by anger hurt and frustration that he went back to an old behavior from his past in which someone hit him for having strong emotionsNow that the incident is past bring up the topic to him so the two of you can discuss itJust the fact of you having empathy and caring what he was feeling at the time may be restorative to himAt the very least you may find out exactly what the answer is to your question as to why he did this in the first place
upset,Anger often comes with a lot of other emotions Consider what else you may be feeling at the same time and keep track of your different mood changes You may be able to notice patterns such as being more frustrated when you dont sleep well If you do feel as though you are mad all the time can you think of any exceptions so you can see what is different in those times
"mad, easily, parents, family",Anger is not necessarily a bad thing If you are angry and you can talk about your feelings that would be very helpful Anger usually comes along with something else like feeling sad worried overwhelmed confused and many others Consider looking at what you notice in addition to anger and you may have a different starting point If you get along well with friends and dont get angry with them look at the differences Do you feel criticized by your parents or family Misunderstood There could be any number of thingsI wonder if you start getting angry very slowly and it builds or if it happens quickly Try to keep an eye on the patterns and see if you can stop and look at what else is going on as you start to get angry Anger is a real emotion in itself It almost always connects to something else as well
"longterm girlfriend, broke up, anger",I need help controlling my angerAnger is like a blanket that contains other emotion from bursting out and serves as a shield to protect us when we are not able to manage external issues   Anger also helps us understand that theres something wrong that needs to change  Once we understand that something else caused us to feel angry then we can explore the source of anger Ask yourself Why am angry Am I hurt disappointed confused embarrassed etc  Once you find the answer explore how often that happens and whats your reaction  Then explore how else you could respond or react  You could use Istatements as a way to communicate your true feelings to your girlfriend or whoever is involved in the scenario  This is a good exercise to practice with your Counselor or mental health provider because many unresolved issues may arise during this exploration especially if you have been angry for a long timeAlso it is important to understand the difference between anger and aggression and learn to manage our anger before we act on it  Anger is a feeling aggression is when you act out your anger physically verbally and psychologically  Find ways to vent crying or sweating will help to release your anger and balance the chemical response that our body creates when you become angry  Physical activity and meditation exercises can also provide a break when you manage strong emotionsNecesito ayuda para controlar mi corajeEl coraje es como una manta que cubre otras emociones evitando que se desborden y sirve como un escudo que nos protege cuando no podemos manejar problemas externos  El coraje también nos ayudo a entender que hay algo mal que debemos cambiar  Cuando entendemos que algo mas causo el coraje entonces podemos explorar la fuentePregúntate a ti mismo Por qué tengo coraje estoy herido decepcionado confundido avergonzado etc  Ya que encuentres la respuesta explora cuan frecuente tienes esa reacción  Luego explora como puedes reaccionar en otra ocasión  Puedes usar expresiones del Yo para comunicar tus verdaderos sentimientos a la persona envuelta en la situación  Esto es un buen ejercicio para practicar con tu Consejero o profesional de la salud mental ya que otros conflictos sin resolver pueden surgir durante este proceso de exploraciónTambién es importante entender la diferencia entre el coraje y la agresión y aprender a manejar el coraje antes que actuemos  El coraje es un sentimiento y la agresión es cuando expresas tu coraje agrediendo a alguien física emocional o sicológicamente  Encuentra maneras de desagotare llorar o sudar te pueden ayudar en este proceso al balancear la respuesta química que crea el cuerpo cuando estamos molestos  El la actividad física y la meditación también pueden ayudarte a relajarte y tomar un descanso cuando manejas emociones fuertes
"violent thoughts, dreams, horrible things happening, loved ones, sickening, horror movie, can't help, pop up",If your son is reporting extremely violent thoughts and dreams please have an psychological evaluation done by a psychiatrist now before it gets even worse for him to bare  Dont take his reports lightly  For him  to tell you he knows that something is not right  He is seeking and needing help  Get it immediately  Best to be safe than sorry
"anger problems, set me off, mood, rage, yell constantly, young babies, growing up, mommy, old self",With me knowing that a healthy relationship usually includes respect trust appreciation companionship spiritual solidarity domestic support feeling of being cherished and  sensuous affection I am wondering if you are lacking in several if not all of these needs in your present relationship  Before he becomes your husband you should examine these areas and see if they are high in rating  Otherwise yes this relationship will affect your girls and you negatively  I would suggest relationship counseling specifically premarital  Not be surprised if through the process you realize that this relationship is not the best choice for you and your children
"sleep deprivation, anger, inability to open up, taking anger out on others, screaming",Best question iswhat are you so angry about  You cant stop being so angry until you figure out what is the root of your anger  If you feel like you have anger inside while I am sure you do  Taking it out on your son is only passing on the hurt and anger  This will be inside him too  Get some professional help so that you can be happy and have a happy child
"angry urges, anger, rage, extreme, disproportionate, violent thoughts, lucid, drown in anger, resentment",Knowing how you feel and also being able to stabilize yourself to act upon the tremendous anger you feel are fine qualitiesAnger whatever the magnitude generally reflects emotional pain that has not yet been placed into wordsTry thinking over your growing up years because maybe you will discover certain repeated dynamics which upset you and that no one helped you feel secure through such timesAlso if either of your parents drank too much and raged when they were drunk you may be repeating their patterns of how to respond to situations   Even without drinking the response patterns of yelling and throwing things are frightening enough to leave a permanent memoryIf this describes part of your childhood then it is possible you are becoming angry because it was the only emotion that either of your parents was able to express
"upset, angry, cursing, offending, mean things, anger, upset, rumors, negative things, lash out, drama, personality, hurt, words, better person, learn, happy, graceful, love, better",Congratulations on making your way to Step One selfobservation and deciding to change a feature about how you understand and relate to othersThere is extraordinary strength in being willing to notice your effect on others and consider what changes are possibleStart on the inside track of your own heart and mind  Once youre able to understand what is driving your emotions to the point where the only reasonable way of handling them is to curse and offend people youd have gotten a long way in knowing your own expectations of others and how far off the mark from this in your mind they areFor example if you expect others to always be accepting tolerant and happy about situations with your boyfriend and youre hearing otherwise from people then you can prepare yourself for possible less than positive comments about your relationship or you can ask people to not comment to you about your relationship at allBasically the more you know about yourself and are willing to accept your right to ask others to respect your views the easier and calmer time youll have in handling comments from others that youre not glad hearingAlso this is a long process because youd be trying to change long time and deep patterns of interactingBe patient with your own learning curve and certainly consider therapy for yourself in order to have some outside guidance and support for the process youre placing yourself
"feelings, anger, notice, express",Well then give yourself some credit for noticing that you recognize at least one feeling that you haveWhat is your own theory as to what is difficult to know your feelings  Your answer will give you clues as to unearthing your willingness to be aware of the way you feelSometimes the family in which someone grew up did all they could to stop the kids from knowing who they wereIn some families there were very severe consequences if a child spoke up with an independent mind  By knowing where your difficulties started you may very well be able to release the situation in which you learned to suppress your feelingsAlso spend some time with yourself just enjoying who you are  Often people who have difficulty in expressing themselves suffered shame and humiliation as a child  They have a chronic sense of worthlessness and feeling worthless certainly works against selfexpression  By having a good time being with yourself you may increase your selfappreciation and this will go a long way to believing that your feelings are worth knowing and stating
"headaches, mouth breathing, snoring, angry, solve it myself",Probably good to know in what type of situations you are in which you are hearing mouth breathing and snoringIf youre sleeping beside your partner who does these actions would have a different response than if you overhear mouth breathing and snoring from a family member who is napping on the couch and you are walking past them on your way to take a snack in the kitchenBasically if the person who does these actions which bother you start by telling themDepending on whether they are empathetic to how distressed you are from their sounds or not willing to change or not has a good deal to do with next stepsI dont really see any step youre able to take to solve that you are sensitive to human sounds from the headOne path I dont recommend is expecting yourself to ignore the fact of being feeling bothered or dismissing your own sensitivity someoneYour needs matter
"anger, possessiveness, urges, push people away, blow up, possessiveness, hurt someone, beg for me, agonizing, painedfilled voices, wrong with me",What result are you hoping to get from the behaviors you describeMaybe start by comparing the results you see yourself receiving from your current interactions with how you would wish to feel from relating to othersSince you ask what is wrong with me there is a disconnect between what you are doing and what youd like in returnThis is true even with imagining doing harm to othersWhat are you really trying to accomplish for yourself by hurting othersBesides the unethicalness and criminality of this and legal consequences of arrest for such behaviors what gain which is not evil do you expect from overpowering and imagining you control another human being
"bad temper, get mad easily, stay like that, whole day, cant help",A lot of times the anger someone expresses is from feeling a deep level hurt within themselves   A surface situation like a store told you theyd have delivery of a certain item by Tuesday and when that particular Tuesday comes the store doesnt have what they told you they would and you are furiousThe fury may have more with many times before in your life having been deeply let down by someone who mattered to your life at the time who similarly promised something and failed to deliver whatever itIf at the time of feeling let down by someone important in your life the relationship didnt allow for honest expression of all your emotions youd have learned to hold in what you realized would not be tolerated if you expressed it clearlyWithout practice of being heard when feeling hurt by someone eventually the person possibly you learned to contain and contain your emotionsIt is possible that the anger you feel at a variety of situations lately are muting hurt feelings that youve understood from relating to meaningful people in your personal history to not talk aboutAs a way to find out if you feel other emotions in addition to anger take some time to reflect on what triggered your anger and whether its possible that hurt emotions which nobody whom you know wants to hear  are really the underlying source of your upsetI hope you will enjoy some new discoveries about yourself and your emotions
"angry, anxiety, stress, violent, aggression",First off it is great that you recognize that some changes need to be made It is also really good that you understand where the source of your anxiety and stress comes from Fortunately there are many self help books and internet sources that provide free tools to help you cope with lifes obstacles including anger management There are several strategies that you can try to help control your anger but the ones that I would recomend first are the following1 Try a different way of communicating with your parents Since arguing with them is a great source of anger for you learning more effective ways of communicating with them will likely be of great benefit Choose a time to talk with them about heated issues when everyone is calm and emotions are not heightened Use I phrases by telling them how the arguments effect you as opposed to placing blame on them Validate what you hear your parents say in order to allow them to know that you understand their point of view2 When you feel yourself becoming angry take a break Simply excuse yourself from the situation find a quiet place to be by yourself and do some deep breathing Close your eyes slowly count to four as you inhale and exhale even slower counting to 6 Focus on nothing except for your breathing and do this for 5 minutes3 Stop any negative thoughts in their tracks Often times when we get upset we catastrophize and do not see things clearly When you catch yourself thinking negatively stop the thoughts and ask yourself if your thinking is logical and rational If you cannot find much or any evidence that your thoughts are valid then let them go and replace them with realistic logical thoughts4 Finally find a friend or someone to talk to andor keep a journal Keeping your emotions to yourself will not help you Being able to express your feelings and problem solve will allow for some relief when feeling sad or angryI wish you all the best
"anger, happy, mood, littlest things, infuriates, normal, anger flares up, terrible pain, chest, fire, gasoline",Hi Nashville Im glad you want this to be different It doesnt feel good to be angry all the time and its stealing your energy as well as affecting relationships Im sureWorking with a therapist you can learn to recognise the deep emotions that lie underneath the anger Its likely to be either powerlessness or worthlessness and what happens is this a small moment in the present touches on an old tender bruised emotion that weve simply felt too much of or too strongly in the past We develop ways of avoiding these vulnerable emotions and anger is one way of doing that So when someone looks at you in a certain way or says something youd rather be angry than feel powerless or unimportant or whatever your kryptonite feeling is In that moment your instinct is to blame whatever happened no matter how small because thats the thing that happened just before you got mad You fail to recognise that the problem is not the look on that persons face or the shoe that someone left in front of the doorits that you cant stand feeling something and you want to avoid it like you want to stamp your foot out if its on fireI suggest finding a therapist to work with You can learn to take responsibility for your old emotions and find new ways to manage them
"emotions, dont like, go off, ticking time bomb, 0 to 100, quickly",Sometimes we react to situations immediately without thinking of the consequences of our actions Typically by not reacting right away we are better able to gather our thoughts see the situation more clearly and from other perspectives and respond more calmly One of the strategies that almost always helps is deep breathing When faced with a stressful situation you can give yourself a time out by removing yourself from the stress and spend 5 minutes taking deep breaths breathe in slowly counting to 4 and breathe out even slower counting to 6 while focusing and thinking only about your breathing After doing so think of the various ways you can respond to the situation and choose the one most appropriate Good luck
"anger, mad, distant, negativity, married, together",Hi Newark It sounds to me like your husband is going through something and I think you understand that You might feel very helpless sad and disrespected at the same time Hes changed Its unfair for him to blame you for his emotions His mood issues are about him not you and hes either not recognising that or not taking responsibility for it Are you respecting yourself here by drawing appropriate boundaries You can let him know when you feel disrespected and whats not okay with youHe may be experiencing depression which often shows up as irritability in men It could be that hes not telling you something or hes unaware of his emotional processes You can try a Im really worried about you You dont seem happy and I dont know how to help you Some things are happening that arent okay with me Will you see a therapist approach Perhaps you could go with him the first time  Its about a combination of compassion selfrespect and seeking professional help I believe I wish you well
"anger, rage, hormones, self-destructive, cutting, biting, pulling hair, scratching, punching, hiding behavior, good family, good relationship, good job, uncontrollable, little things, petty things",Hi Im glad you wrote In general when a small thing bothers us and this happens to all of us its because the small thing triggers an emotion in us that we have felt too much or too intensely in the past and we dont know how to manage that emotion effectivelywe just want to avoid it as quickly as possible Cognitive Behavioural Therapy with a qualified therapist can help you to understand what is being triggered in you and learn how to manage emotions productively You say that your behaviours are self destructive and I agree It sounds like you have developed a habit of channelling your distress towards selfharm and this is a separate and potentially more serious problem This is a choice you make that points to shame being an issue for you Again a good therapist can help you learn whats behind your shame and selfharm Your feelings are normal and you can learn more healthy ways to deal with them with qualified help
"anger, recognize, no control, managing, suggestions",I suggest that you work on emotional awareness Emotional awareness basically means knowing what you are feeling and whyEmotional awareness also means that you can identify the link between the way you are feeling and your actions In other words knowing that your feelings dictate what you doOften feelings of hurt or insecurity can come out as anger if we cannot properly identify and express the feelingsBeing emotionally aware also means that you are able to express your feelings to others Being unable to do so leads to feelings of frustration and being misunderstoodMany people for many different reasons are not in touch with their emotions For example men traditionally have been brought up taught to not express sadness or weakness Therefore many men learned to turn feelings of sadness insecurities or fears into anger and express these feelings as anger Being taught not to feel a certain emotion does not make that emotion disappear Instead it makes us learn how to express it in other incorrect ways If a man never learns to say I am sad or that really hurt my feelings and instead lashes out in anger then the response they get from those around them will be to the anger and not a response to the underlying true feeling which will leave the man feeling alone and misunderstoodYou can control yourself and not explode Walk away remove yourself from the situation do whatever you have to do to not lash out Instead of reacting the way you normally would go somewhere by yourself and think about what just happened and try to understand why such a simple thing upset you What is the real feeling driving these outbursts Maybe you can begin to recognize an underlying pattern It might help to keep an anger journal Write down everything that gets you upset That might help you see a pattern and pinpoint what may be setting you off Talking with a therapist about this would be beneficial in helping pinpoint the underlying cause of the outbursts you are experience
"horrendous nightmares, whole month",Theres a narrative approach that we call nightmare rescripting that may be helpfulSince we cant really control the nature of our dreams while theyre happening we try to alter them while we are in a waking state  In a nutshell this refers to first writing out in detail the events of a recurring nightmare you have Typically there is an element of fear danger or helplessnessSecond we rescript the nightmare by changing what happens in the dream in a way that engenders feelings of empowerment control competence andor safety In other words if the nightmare involved being pursued or assaulted we might change the events of the story so that you call the police get to a place of safety or even fight back and protect yourselfThird you can reread this new version of the dream over and over again so that it becomes a well rehearsed story The effect of this can make it so that the next time your mind goes towards the nightmare while sleeping this new more hopeful and empowering story competes with the old one and reduces the level of distress associated with the dream Best of luck
"uncontrollable swallowing, repetitive, out of body feeling, lasts no more than a minute or two, bed at night, during the day, benign brain tumor, not associated",Im not entirely sure whether this relates to something in the mental health realm or if there is something else happening I know you said that your doctor said it is not related to your physical condition but have you tried speaking with your primary care physician Ive seen people with many different symptoms that end up being related to acid reflux or something of that nature As far as the out of body experience there are different stages of sleep so if this is happening in the middle of the night and you are waking up from a dream you may not be fully awake when its going on These are just some thoughts but I think talking to your primary care physician would be a great place to start
"alcoholic, hate, stresses me out, sober, refuse, tired, barely sleeping, over sleep, small town, not really that close","Hello and thank you for your question You are clearly a
resourceful young person to reach out like this to find help Good for you I
have a few ideas and perhaps some other counselors will add some thoughts too

First good for you for taking care of yourself and making
really good decisions  such as not getting into the car with dad when he is
intoxicated It is really important that you consider your safety above all
else 
To answer your heading question yes it is quite common for
people to blame themselves for other peoples actions There are various
reasons why we do this For one thing someone may tell us that their behaviors are our fault And depending on things like our relationship to that
person past experiences and our selfesteem we may actually start to believe
it What is important to remember is that your parents have the responsibility
to be sure that you are safe and
cared for not the other way around 
As for the other things you mentioned I am concerned about both
your physical and emotional safety and wellbeing It sounds like your father
has an alcohol abuse problem and living with someone who is struggling with
addiction can be hard for anyone let alone a teenager who is also trying to
deal with things like school 
You may want to see if your school has a counselor or
someone you can talk to about what is going on I will tell you that in some
states what you have told me may be something that a counselor would have to
report to child protection services but not necessarily If you are concerned
about that ask the counselor what they are obligated to report 
If you dont know a counselor think about any other adult
that you would feel comfortable talking to They may have some ideas 
Sometimes individual states have nonprofit chat lines or
hotlines for teens to call if they are struggling with things You may be able
to find something like that in your state I do warn your about doing random
searches not every website is good so be careful 
This is clearly a tough spot for you to be in so one of the
things that I encourage you to do while searching for support is to focus on
taking care of yourself Sometimes things like this can really bring us down and
we stop doing the things we enjoy Try really hard not to let that happen If
you have interests do them If you catch yourself thinking too hard about
things try to find something fun to do to distract yourself Try to take care
of yourself in other ways such as eating well Exercise can really help when
we get stressed 
I hope some of this was helpful Good luck

"fall asleep, nightmares, frightened, unable to breathe, losing sleep, breaking up, stress, life lost meaning, running, exercise, release stress, improve symptoms, chronic condition, bankrupt, solve issue","Youre noticing that as you lie down to go to sleep there
is quite a bit going on which may be anxiety related It sounds like the
dreams and difficulty sleeping are reminiscent of previous experiences you had
around the time of your break up the difficulty with your fathers business
and your mothers health issues These connections to past events may be
important insights to continue exploring in addition to finding out more about
what your dreams may be trying to tell you There is no exact science to
dreams but many people find it fruitful to explore the content as it relates to
significant themes in their lives I think that exploring these issues further with
a therapist could help you resolve whatever is causing you the stress trouble sleeping and frightening dreams"
"Sometimes, night, times",Perhaps more dreaming means that you are making use of your mind to solve problems  I find that change states while sometimes difficult are very exciting  They give you opportunity to grow more rapidly  So I say congratulations  Mark wwwMarkMorrisLCSWcom and wwwLivingYesorg
"trust issues, opening up, feelings for someone, freaking out, help needed",One way to concentrate is that if your mind starts to wonder then remind yourself to bring your attention backStart with short time spans of expecting yourself to concentrate  Youll more likely succeed with concentrating with small time spans than longer onesOnce you start seeing your success this will motivate you to try increasing the length to expect yourself to concentrateThe task of selfreminding is the same whether for long or short time periodsAlso before starting this exercise ask your medical doctor if the problem can be related to a physical health problemIf there is then have the possibility ruled out that your difficulty concentrating comes from the mental ability to concentrate and not some medical reason preventing thisBefore someone can engage their psychological will there must be a clean medical body and mind with which to work
"married for 11 years, drifted far apart, coexist together, personal interest, emotional invested, feel alone, uncared for, reconnected",Your question highlights your pain very clearly  What you are describing is one of the most common scenarios I see in my practice with couples One partner feels terribly lonely and unimportant in response to the other partner either turning towards other people and activities or being withdrawn and turning inward My mind immediately goes to a question for you What happens when you are feeling alone and uncared for What do you say to yourself about you about your spouse and about your relationship  What do you do in response to these feelings Do you ask for what you need  Does this lead to arguments  Do you stay silent or withdrawVery often couples enter into negative patterns where one partner feels afraid of rejection by the other partner and so withdraws from the relationship and is often seen as cold and aloof towards the relationship and the other partner feels afraid of abandonment by the withdrawing partner and so pursues the other and is often seen as critical and nagging  Regardless of who started it these patterns can turn into infinity loops that take on a gravity of their own and ultimately cause both partners to withdraw and dissolve the relationship  If both partners want to work on saving and improving the relationship the way out of this is to learn about your emotions and patterns together so that you can slow down the pattern and stay in touch with the emotions that pull people together  As the patterns slow down partners are better able to get more deeply in touch with their vulnerabilities needs and longings and ask for them to be met in such a way that doesnt leave the other partner feeling criticized threatened abandoned or uncared forSome couples can do this without the help of a therapist  The book Hold Me Tight 7 Conversations for a LIfetime of Love by Sue Johnson is a selfhelp book based on Emotionally Focused Therapy the most scientifically validated couples therapy that currently exists and has been helpful to many couples that I see  When a therapist is needed to help partners reconnect or overcome betrayals I recommend seeking couples therapists who are trained in a scientifically tested model of couples therapy such as Emotionally Focused Therapy  You can learn more about EFT or find an EFT therapist here httpwwwiceeftcomTo summarizeYour pain is understandable and valid  Its telling you what you are missing and what you wantReconnection comes when we can listen to what our feelings are telling us express those feelings in a safe way and assert our wantsneeds while remaining open to the vulnerabilities and needs of our partnerIf you can do that on your own and your relationship is responsive thats fantastic  If you encounter challenges in resolving this yourself consider therapy with a trained couples therapist using a model that is scientifically validated  Pain means this is important  You and your marriage are worth the effort
"uncomfortable, girlfriend, showing off, body, poses, social media, proud, respect, openly, bring up, calling her a whore, deal with, hurt her feelings",Ask her to consider your feelings not only her own defensiveness that she is called a whore by youClearly since youre writing on a site which offers psychological and emotional support and guidance you do not consider your gf to be a whoreShe may not realize or considered that you are somewhat protective of who sees her body   In the end she may not want the privacy over her body which you are encouraging her to haveAt least you will have the satisfaction to know you stated your actual reasons for your request and did not rely on the ones she imagined you have
"first threesome, drinking, feeling better, craving more, empty feeling, feeling this way",As someone who specializes in sexuality and polyamory I can tell you that your experience is incredibly common It can be helpful to keep in mind that alcohol lowers our inhibitions and for first time threesomes or any new sexual behavior really we humans tend to enjoy a little extra oomph to our courage levels That being said it also lowers our ability to make well thoughtout decisions This combined with the brain rewarding novelty new lover new experience with our partner etc and maybe even some overzealousness and performance anxiety could likely explain why your husband was on her more than you My encouragement to you is to try not to overthink it at this stage Now IF you two choose to bring her or someone else into the bedroom again and a similar thing keeps happening I would definitely push the issue and see whats up from his perspectiveThe empty feeling could be any number of things includingFear that youre not enough for himFear that shes better than you in some wayFear that if we keep doing this thing he will need it and what happens if I no longer want itOpposite fear of what if I now want her more than him or if I want the threesomes and he doesntFear of does this mean our sex life isnt good enough as it isdo we have to always add a little spice to keep it hotOr like Robin alluded to preconceived notions about what culture religion family and friends etc say about what marriage and sex should look like  I also agree with her encouragement to explore the empty feeling further and see what nuances of other feelings are in therejealousy insecurity shame regret longing  When you can identify and name them they are easier handled Some of the resources I recommend poly sexually open couples areLove in Abundance a Counselors Advice on Open Relationships by Kathy LabriolaThe Jealousy Workbook Exercises and Insights for Managing Open Relationships by Kathy LabriolaRewriting the Rules an Integrative Guide to Love Sex and Relationships by Meg BarkerMore Than Two a Practical Guide to Ethical Polyamory by Franklin Veaux  Eve RickertThe Game Changer a Memoir of Disruptive Love by Franklin VeauxThe Ethical Slut a Practical Guide to Polyamory Open Relationships and Other Adventures by Dossie Easton  Janet HardyOpening Up a Guide to Creating and Sustaining Open Relationships by Tristan TaorminoOpen All the Way Confessions From my Open Marriage by Sadie SmytheHenry and June From A Journal of Love  The Unexpurgated Diary of Anais Nin 19311932Personally I find your cravings to be healthy and quite normal The key is to make them work well for you and your partners Robins also right about communication being key Some of the suggested resources above can help get those conversations started And if you need further assistance absolutely I would find a sexpositive polypositive counselor to chat withBest of luck to youTamara Powell LMHC
"cheated, husband, married, work, caught on, lie, talk to girls online, affair",Whether to divorce or not depends on your reasoning to do soMarriage is its own unique existence dependent on what the partners want from itExamine your terms of satisfaction from the marriageMaybe you have very clear reasons to continue the marriageMaybe you dontOnly you can decide if what youre contributing and benefitting is satisfying enough to stay
"low sex drive, disconnected, married for seven years, only had sex four or five times, most men would have left me, want to be better connected",There are many different ways that can be approached in your situation1 I would recommend a complete medical examination including blood test i would want to know if there are any medical issues in your low sex drive2 Where is your husband in this situation Is he resentful accepting demanding or neutral3 What is your past sexual history has this had an affect on your current issue4Has there been problems in your past with abuse of any kind5 Understand that intimacy is more than sex What other ways can you be close to your spouse6 It sounds like there is some confusion about sexual intimacy from both of youCouples counseling would be a great place to start All of these areas need to be explored before any treatment goals can be establishedYou need to talk with a professional counselor to explore how to better connect with your spouse
"red light district, Amsterdam, tested for stds, aftermath, total blackout, touched by a prostitute, had sex",Unfortunately you will never know the true answer This is really frustrating to hear but you will never 100 be able to guarantee that he has given you the truth So if you can work on accepting that breathing through thatHe may not fully remember he may have lied to you in the past or he is lying now He may have been honest then or he may be honest not As for options you can talk to him and provide a safe space for him to tell you what happened This could be a private conversation with you or at a counseling session He would need to feel safe to tell you the truth But remember there are no guarantees You would need to make a decision to trust him or not And go from there A couples counselor can help guide that conversation and make sure that he is feeling safe to share More important than if he actually had sex or not I would evaluate your relationship Do you trust him now Were there trust issues before Does he hide things now Identifying your current trust levels will be important for having a healthy relationship now Hope this helps even if it is frustrating to not have guarantees
"fights, fault, bashes, addicted, substances, young child",Strengthen your own belief in your right to a decent life and respect of who you areFrom the brief description you write your husband has very limited capacity to recognize how others feel and even less capacity to empathize with the personThe best you can do is convince yourself of your own worth and associate with others who believe similarly about your qualities
"emotions, symptoms, situation, sexual attention, cheated, confused, move on",Infidelity is common In a largest study conducted to date about 1015 of women and 2025 of men admitted to being unfaithful while in a monogamous relationship You are not alone and you can get through this just like countless couples have done before you First of all you need to know that although there may be reasons for his behaviour eg not feeling sexually satisfied those are not excuses He could have chosen to masturbate instead of cheating on you right Your partner needs to own his choices and if he is capable of doing it and is truly willing to work on the relationship with you to make it stronger more transparent and more fulfilling for both of you then there is hope The question is  are you willing to put in all this extra work Forgiveness is not easy and it may take a lot of time and effort for you to consciously choose to trust again It wont just happen if you dont work on it And yes its unfair that you are being asked to work on this when he is the one who had been unfaithful Even though it is hard you need to be able to let go at some point of having all the power in the relationship because right now you have it as the one who had been cheated on You cannot hold on to being the victim forever because it will create an imbalance in your relationship making it less healthy in the longrun All of this is hard work Is he and this relationship worth it Are you equally committed to making it work If so dont abandon this relationship just yet Work on it together ideally get a few sessions with an experienced couple counsellor and see where that gets you For additional specific ideas check out my tips for how to deal with infidelity in a relationship Good luck
"friends, talking, having fun, met a girl, talked, flirted, gave our numbers, few months, met up again, kissed, dating, boyfriend",Im sorry for your disappointment with this girlMaybe next time you start to like someone talk with the person to find out if they feel similar to you   This way you have a good chance to avoid being hurt in the way you describe hereEven if the person doesnt give you a straightforward answer to their feelings for you youll gain a little more information by listening to how seriously they consider your question what their body language is like whether or not the person seems sincereListen to your gutIf you feel unsure the person likes you as much as you like them then wait a little while to see if your feelings about the person or their feelings about you change and in what direction they changeKeep yourself informed as best you can so youll know you did as much as possible to kiss someone who understands your kiss the way you mean it to be understood
"band camp, intimate, busy, sensitive",Well yes physical intimacy does give all sorts of positive feelings  The sudden withdrawal of these is certainly possible to trigger a reaction like the one you describe
"emotional affair, exwife, dinner alone, drinking, counseling, friends, chance, open, second night, same bed, daughter, sex",I agree with you that professional counseling is a wise choice for your relationshipYour husband may not know want to know or want to discuss with you what his true feelings are toward you and the exThe topic is very heated which is why discussing these matters alone may do more harm than goodUsually people start deeply complex emotional matters discussion and get so upset the conversation goes off track and unintended hurts happenIn a therapist office the two of you will be guided on talking about these critical areas and this will be much more productive than trying to do so only with the two of you
"busy, clean all the time, go out places, little fights, work it out, don't know how",Maybe your girlfriend feels torn in her emotions between loyalty toward her family and toward investing herself in a relationshipThere are so many maybes that the best way to strengthen your relationship is to ask your girlfriend if she feels any pressure from her family to avoid involving herself with youIf the answer is no then continue to talk with each other as to what would make you each feel more secure with one anotherAlso more simply are the  two of you able to resolve the little fightsDifferences of opinion are normal between two people even to the point of each person feeling they are the only one who knows the correct answerAs long as each one of you has the goodwill to give a little then the fights are a healthy way to respect and care about each otherIf the fights are about the same topic which repeats itself then there are strong differences between the two of you including the possibility that her family places and she is willing to accept some obstacle to this relationship
"emotions, symptoms, situations, attempted to commit suicide, terrible position, enormous load, angry, depression, bad habits, feel awful, selfish",Your compassionate reach out to the friend is praiseworthyThat your ex bf has trouble accepting your gesture as kindness shows your ex bf is not seeing the situation clearlyI believe your ex bfs words about feeling burdened by your actionHowever he is mixing up his own responsibility to know the root of his feelingsBlaming you for feelings he doesnt understand within himself is unfair and not helpful to anyone including himFrom what you write you did nothing wrong and your action toward the potential suicider was graciousMy only guess which is also very general about your ex bfs behavior is that he doesnt yet fully understand himself and finds blaming others easier than understanding himself
"emotions, back away, asking for too much, fix things, worse, make us better, dont know how",Have you asked your boyfriend directly this questionIt is a good question and possibly would open a necessary clarifying discussion as to what each of you expects from the other
"close female friend, bothered, close, meet, worse, couple, friends, physical interaction, talks a lot, leaving him, option",I wonder if you could have a conversation with your boyfriend about how you are feeling A few things may help with thatTry having the conversation you are both able to have a conversation about something that is important for example not during a commercial for a TV showMaybe your boyfriend will be willing to listen to you for about five minutes asking questions to learn more about your experience kind of like an investigative reporter wouldSee if your boyfriend is able to capture the essence of what youre saying by summarizing it for youRemember that hearing you and following what youre saying does not mean that he agreesAlso consider if there are events in your past that are affecting the way you are looking at this relationship between your boyfriend and this other girl we all bring our own histories into relationships and we unconsciously expect that what has worked in other relationships will work in current onesThen you can switch so that you can hear more about what he is experiencing for example what it is that he likes about herAlso consider having a discussion that if one of you becomes very emotional and needs a break from the discussion discuss having a timeout that will last for a certain time frame usually between 15 minutes and one hour and then come back to continue the discussionRemember that the goal here is just to learn more about what each of you is going through not to find a solution right awayThis can be difficult Consider working with a couples therapist to discuss it together
"emotions, married, messing around, other men, once in a while, happening a lot, dont know what to do",Hello and thank you for your question When faced with these kinds of difficult challenges I usually encourage people to look to their values for help in determining what their behavior should be Indeed it is usually when our behaviors conflict with our values that we dont feel very content with our lives Perhaps you can take some time to think through a couple of these questions What kind of person do I want to be deep in my heart What kind of character do I want to have when in public and in my private world when nobody is watching How would I want others to describe me Lets say that you want others to see you as being authentic and YOU also value authenticity as something you want to live by You may feel like this value is currently at odds with the behaviors you are engaging in right now That you are not being the person that you really are deep in your heart This is not an unusual struggle when it comes to sexual behavior and sexual orientation So please try not to feel alone We all know quite well how unacceptable it may be to be seen as gay lesbian bisexual etc And I am not just talking about being unaccepted by others but a person may have a VERY hard time accepting themselves Thinking about your values and living a life based on them can bring a lot of freedom but I wont lie it can also bring a lot of pain at the same time For example someone with the value of living authentically may decide they have to tell others who they are and what they stand for even if that means people may disapprove That may cause a lot of pain but it may also come with a sense of freedom to live a life based on honesty and authenticity It may be helpful to find a counselor who is trained in affirmative therapy which is recommended for people who are navigating their sexual behaviors and figuring out what is right for them I would also sit down and think through some of the questions above and consider what your values are both as an individual and as someones fiancéAbove all I wish you well in this journey Robin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC
"lied, fake relationships, concerning, fake photos, phone calls, text messages, married man, kids, dangerous, ruin lives",Is being friends with this person safe for youLiars dont generally distinguish who they bring down with them or in service to themselvesStep one is to understand a true friendship which is based on trust is probably not possible with this personIf youd like to offer words of advice to protect her from herself then try gently pointing out that some of her actions which you know about may come around to harm herThere is only a small chance she will be open to hearing youPeople who lie are also very fearful of trusting others including themselves  She may prefer to keep status quo than open her own emotional pain to understand what created the need to lie in the first place
"lost his dad to suicide, died so did his heart, cant be there for me, love me anymore, wants nothing to do with me, very happy together, done nothing wrong, cant be with me",I am sorry to learn of this  You must be extremely frustrated and heartbroken  To begin he is correct  You have done nothing wrong  This is entirely a coping mechanism in overdrive  It is fear  It is anger  It is extreme sadness  It is feelings of abandonment  It is intense emotional pain  It is his way of protecting himself from potential unexpected additional lossI am not familiar with how old this post is but often it will require time and understanding  If he speaks with you encourage him to get grief counseling  Do not encourage it for your relationship encourage it for his betterment coping with losing his dad  Start there  Good Luck
"exboyfriend broke up, cant get close, completely over him, break down walls, let someone new in",Hi Bend Youre scared right That makes sense Each time we have a breakup we are a bit more in touch with how much is at stake in this whole love and relationship business We are falling in love and letting someone close to our hearts and theres a vulnerability in that we can get hurt Who you partner with longterm is a big decision and it determines 90 of our happiness in life The good news is that when were just starting to get to know someone we can take it slow I think maybe you are slowing yourself down instinctively here and thats okay We are naturally people of attachment and it wont likely last if you are normally an open and accessible person who doesnt put up walls So part of what I want to say here is dont pressure yourself too much Take the time to heal naturally and listen to your instinct that is telling you to take things slow As well there are a few things you can do to make sure that the walls do eventually come down or will come down for the right person First think about the lessons you learned from this past relationship What do you feel proud of What do you need in a partner What mistakes did you make Use this experience to grow in your awareness of how you work in a relationship and what you need from a partnerLook at your thoughts Are you having generalized negative thoughts like No one will ever love me again or Im going to get hurt again or I cant trust myself If so write down what these thoughts are and then ask yourself what evidence supports these thoughts Fear tries to convince us that there is either something wrong with us or that something bad will happen but it does so with little or no evidence of this ever happening It sells us a line based on no concrete evidence Then ask yourself what evidence supports the opposite thought What is the evidence that I am lovable that there are safe good people out there that I can trust myself Eliminate the negative thoughts and add the positive ones Its simple but very powerfulLastly take concrete and careful steps to act as though there are no walls What is the evidence of the walls Can you take purposeful baby steps in the direction of lowering those walls When we act as though something is true we start to feel it and believe it moreI hope you will find yourself back on track eventually with time
"snit, silent treatment, sarcastic, hurtful, wrong, apologizes",You are in an abusive relationshipnot because of your boyfriends silences but because he is comfortable being sarcastic and hurtful never admits he is wrong and never apologizes It is your choice to participate in an abusive relationship You can not stop an abusive partner from being abusive no matter how wonderfully you treat your partner You can either accept the terrible relationship as it is or reach out for the support that you need to leave the abusive relationship I wish you well always
"cheated, pregnant, split, worked things out, trusted, married, flirts, talked, nothing helps",This sounds very painful for youAre you able to tell him how his flirting affects youMaybe he doesnt care enough to change and maybe he doesLong term if he continues this then usually people feel they have two choices put up with it which of course greatly reduces the sense of satisfaction in the relationship   Or of course you can decide to end the relationship  This choice is quite significant now that you have a child together  Give yourself plenty of time to think over the best outcome
"broken up, found our way back, love, jealous, ignores my calls",Your story sounds like it gives you a great deal of tension and disappointmentYou know you are not getting the amount of love and kind of relationship youd likeIt is almost as though you feel that something is better than nothingReflect within yourself whether the balance of what you receive in this relationship is worth the sacrifice of not getting as much love as you wishDepending on your decision you will know whether to drop this relationship or continue the same as its been
"mentally abused, change, stay strong, completely broken, holding on, hope, wasting time",I think your own awareness will not allow you to continue in a bad relationshipBe glad something within you is telling you that there are better ways to be treated than how your husband doesFor support and guidance in real time look up the organizations in your area which help women to leave abusive relationshipsYou are not the first or only one and probably not the last woman who wants to leave an abusive partner  Having guidance particular to you and your situation will help you move through what decisions to make as to how to leave this man
"disagreeing, opposite things, trust issues, happy medium, nonnegotiable, not sure, enemy, kills me",Theres a difference between what you want what you need and what you have Being able to assertively identify express your wants and needs to your boyfriend may be helpful in times of negotiation Often couples focus on recounting all the negative traits and issues when is time to negotiate and that impairs the ability to explore and find solutions objectivelyYou could use couples mediation to learn assertive communication skills and filter the information needed to resolve or negotiate a solution Mi novio no transa conmigoÚltimamente mi novio y yo hemos tenido muchos desacuerdos Todo se debe al hecho de que queremos cosas diferentes  Yo hago mucho por él lo cuido y protejo y al final el no confía en mí  Ambos hemos llegado a la conclusión que cuando yo quiero algo que él no quiere él no está dispuesto a encontrar el punto medio  No es negociable  No estoy segura de que hacer El no confía en mi tanto como quisiera que lo hiciera a veces siento su enemiga y eso me mata Hay una gran diferencia entre lo que quieres lo que necesitas y lo que tienes  Poder identificar y expresar asertivamente lo que quieres y necesitas en tu relación te ayudara en los momentos de negociación   Muchas veces las parejas se enfocan en recontar todos los problemas y características negativas a la hora de negociar y eso les impide hablar claramente del problema presente e identificar soluciones específicasPueden usar la mediación de parejas para aprender técnicas de comunicación asertiva y tener asistencia filtrando e identificando la información que les ayudara a resolved o negociar una solución al problema
"pushing people away, great boyfriend, loves me, keep pushing him away, learn to open up",Figuring out the space we need between ourselves and others is an ongoing and unsolvable task  But it sounds like you may be feeling stuck in a pattern of pushing people away and are wanting to change that  Pushing others away may be your way of surviving relationships and may have proven to be very helpful at one point in your life  Or it may be serving some other purpose  One helpful way to consider changing that is to seek out a therapist  Psychotherapy can provide you with a relationship that is in tune to you and that can provide the reflection and supportive challenges to help determine the function the pushing away is serving  It also may be helpful for you to take time to reflect on the moments when interpersonal guardedness snuck its way into the interaction  What were you feeling right before this  Did it provide relief  Reflecting on what was happening just before and right after can provide some clues as to what purpose the pushing away servesIt may be helpful to communicate to the boyfriend how you experience intimacy and the discomfort it can bring you at times  This may help him be as sensitive as you need him to be about the pace of the relationship and to understand what may be happening when you push him away
"dating my boyfriend, eight years, met in college, good to bad, met his family, treats him like, expect him to take them on dates, movies, out to eat, thinks its okay",Well then you learned something new about your boyfriendAre you fine with having a different opinion than him and staying togetherThink over how major a problem this is to you and if it is reason enough to leave the relationshipThere are always plenty of areas of disagreement between partners in a relationshipThe key to being happy is to know which ones you can accept and which ones are beyond your tolerance with which to liveAlso an early step would be to directly tell your boyfriend your opinion   He may be willing to change his ways to satisfy you
"lied about his past, present situations, changed, doubts, stay or go, hate this feeling, don't trust him, hasn't done anything, trust him recently",Your doubts about your dating partner need to be addressed and solved so you can fully believe him againOtherwise how would you actually know whether hes lying to you now or notStart the conversation with him about wanting to trust him and asking for whatever details you feel will give you confidence he is telling you the truthIf he really wants to clear your doubts then he will be willing to invest in answering your extra questions or wanting to look through his phone or whatever areas you felt were violated by him in the past
"feel like, takes advantage, kindness, put them first, not enjoying, engagement",Congrats on your upcoming weddingHave you told the thoughts you write here to your fiancé This is the place to start since you clearly are unhappy with a part of his and now your life which will be with you for quite some time
"dating my boyfriend, lied, slept with, get back at, breaking up, wont believe, being honest, dont know, constantly criticizes",Start a conversation with him about your sincere interest to earn back his trustAsk him what he expects from you so that he will trust you againIf you are consciously willing and do try to earn back his trust and have periodic conversations with him on whether he feels more at ease with trusting you then after a few months of this both of you should feel more secure in the relationship
"care about, teachable, irritating, happy, wanted, please, fall short",Pleasing someone certainly does feel satisfying  If the other person does not appreciate your effort and good will then this feels dissatisfyingOffering happiness to someone does not include tolerating mean comments such as the ones you describe hereTell the person that you are trying to please them and also tell the person that their comments are hurtfulIf the person said their words with no bad intentions then next time they comment its reasonable to expect these comments to not hurt your feelingsKeep in mind that your good intentions may not be received in the way you intend them  Some people sometimes are insensitive or just plain not interested in being pleased by another person
"trust, nice, sweet, immature, compromise, decisions, fighting, dates, supporting, spoiling, loyal, cheat, sweet things",Well then your decision is whether you want to stay in this type of relationship or notOne point to keep in mind is thisJust because hes not telling you his opinions doesnt mean he doesnt have any opinionsIn the long run t is always easier to talk with someone about their differences from our point of view than to be someone who doesnt tell you what is in their mindShort term it seems easy to have someone agreeableLong term someone who doesnt tell you their thoughts and who disagrees with you may potentially go about their true wishes in hidden ways
"close friendship, long distance, anger, jealousy, feeling taken away, frustration, apologies",You are definitely in a frustrating situationYour friend and the boyfriend are doing what is natural for couples who are in the early stage of their relationship  Being almost inseparable to the point of overlooking friends is understandable as long as it doesnt continue for long enough that friends feel hurtIf you feel you would like to one more time tell your friend that you miss your friendship with her and would like her attention then do soAfter expressing your needs as much as possible and if the result doesnt change then the sad conclusion is that your friend is willing to give you less time and energy than you require from her
"dating websites, beautiful, phone hacked, happened two other times, loves me, only girl, not telling the truth",Tell him what you know and ask why he is lying to you   If he tells you he isnt lying and you have proof that he is then you can either accept that he denies the truth or not
"boyfriend, touch me intimately, kiss me, having sex, oral sex, other women, past, emotions, symptoms, situations",First off dont blame yourself or be too quick to jump to any scary conclusions  Human sexuality can be incredibly complex at times eg what turns us on at one time may not be what turns us on the next time There could actually be a number of things going on including him having performance anxietymaybe he had a bad experience with a previous partner thats left him scared to try again we call this operant conditioning  It could also be that he puts you in a different category than previous lovers  Sometimes I refer to this as the hookerhousewife mentality where a partner somehow gets the idea that when we truly fall in love we treat that one differently almost up on a pedestal  Drives many partners crazy until theyre aware that this is going on and give their boyfriend girlfriend permission to enjoy both the naughty and the nice with them It could also be that hes not even aware that hes not doing these things If you havent asked him yet you might try gently approaching the subject when youre not already in the bedroom or trying to get in on and inquire what he most enjoys about sex with you or has enjoyed in the past or thinks he might enjoy  You can also share your favorite highlights of sex with him  Give him an ego boost and tell him what he does well while then asking him if hed be down to go downtown  Baby it REALLY turns me on when you kiss me during sexIf you continue to get the impression that its somehow only about YOU or that hes just really hesitant to talk about sex in general you might see if hed be cool to chat with a counselor who specializes in sexual intimacy
"rough patch, relationship, choice words, emotions, symptoms, situations",Your boyfriend and you have a separate relationship than your relationship with your mother   By trying to control whether or not you visit your mom unless you are in agreement with this is building tension between you and himAsk why he resents your interest to see your motherIf he is insecure to the point where he fears your mother will influence your opinion about him then trying to prevent you from visiting your mom is itself creating negativity in you toward himIf something still bothers him about the problems you both had several months ago then talking about these problems will do more to clear the air between the two of you than him trying to interfere in your relationship with your mother
"pedophile, attracted, girlfriend, under 18, 15, 14",You are not a pedophile You are both under 18 and your age is appropriate for a relationship There would be a possible problem if she was 10 or younger Pedophelia is a whole other problem that you probably should not be worried about I would be happy to talk with you in more detail about this
"crossdress, feminine, attracted to women, bother, date, ask out, approach, hold back, secret, upfront, wonder, stop, happy, what should I do",Thanks for asking this question I think the most important part of what you mentioned was that you do it because it makes you happy For that reason I would encourage you to keep doing what makes you happyAs far as telling girls or keeping it a secret I dont really think that its necessarily one or the other at least not the first time that you meet In other words one part of your decisionmaking could be whether it is something that you always want to address in the first date or perhaps something that you address after youve known each other for a couple of meetings The answer to that question may also change depending on who you are dating I would imagine that each person that you are with mainly due to a different decision this was when to disclose this It sounds like this is an important part of you so I would think that if you were going to date someone longterm you would want them to know about the most important parts of you including thatI also encourage you to remember that if you meet someone who is not comfortable with this that does not mean that there is anything wrong with what you are doing but rather something that the other person is in some way deciding not to continue learning about or choosing to have someone they are dating like to crossdressId also ask you to consider this Are the people who you say this to expecting it My guess is that the answer is probably not Along with that Are they going to have questions I would imagine soAre you comfortable answering questionsI wonder if you could figure out yourself or with friends or perhaps even with a therapist how you would answer these sorts of questionsWhat exactly is crossdressingDoes that change the gender that youre attracted toWhat does it mean to youWhy is it important to youAnd what you want your listening person to know about you related to crossdressingThere could even be ways that you can start the conversation by asking them to be open to listen to you and ask questions about what they are thinking before they make any quick decisions about you or the relationshipI certainly hope that you find the right person for you I imagine that having this conversation could be stressful especially considering the idea that you have had some negative reactions in the past Remember that talking this through with a therapist could be very helpful
"alcohol addiction, issues, past, stop drinking, confronted, lied, missing beers, admitted, apologized, promise, drinking every night, New Years resolution, limit alcohol consumption, passed out, confront, snores, cannot sleep, overreacting, honest, good husband",As exasperated as you feel and as obvious it is to you that your husband cares more about drinking than being honest with you changing this is up to himDoes he care that youre upset with him for drinking more than he can handleDoes he care about you more than drinkingLiving with an alcoholic which is how his behavior sounds is lonely and frustratingConcentrate on what you like about him as he is now with his drinkingYour happiness matters  His ignoring of what youre talking about doesnt mean your requests are unreasonableBe prepared to learn to live with and accept how he behaves or notAvoid the expectation that you can convince him to changePeople change only when they realize their life can improve by changing  He doesnt sound like this at least now
"love, girlfriend, erection, thinking, seeing, sex, tried, couldnt get, long time ago, happening, what can I do",Im sorry to hear of your problemFirst step as always when a possible medical explanation exists go for a urology check up to either your internist or a urologistOnce you know there is no medical reason which would prevent an erection then we can consider the psychological and emotion based factorsMaybe youre nervous about your sexual performance or that your gf may be disappointed in your performanceMen often mistake their own fears of performance failure with the assumption that their partner thinks about sex as a performanceTalk with your gf about whatever is on your mind which may inhibit you from enjoying sexThe reasons are endlessWhat matters is to have a heartfelt dialogue with each otherThe emotional support which comes through such an intimate conversation may very well be the catalyst for a more relaxed and satisfying approach to sex w your gf
"separated, asked about her contact, male friend, kicked me out, move back, divorce, changed her mind, other guy, factor, not my business",When threats of leaving such as what you described in your question kicking you out wanting divorce are continuous in your marriage it can start to erode at the foundation of your relationship impacting both partners And if youre concerned about the influence of another male in the relationship and are unable to express your concerns or fears to your wife its extremely difficult to build a secure functioning relationship From the information provided in your question it seems as if there is some avoidance evident in your relationship Avoidance of being able to express yourself and have honest communication about your relationship If your wife is willing I would recommend seeing a marriage counselor to help you both during this time Or for you to talk with an individual therapist if marriage counseling isnt an option
"affection, push away, kiss, hug, touch, birth control, sex drive, love, emotions, symptoms, situations",I sympathize with you It is actually quite common for one partner to have a higher sex drive than the other and can lead to discord in the relationship The good news is there are ways to deal with thisYou may have already answered your question There are many medications that can alter ones sex drive If your birth control pills are the cause of this talk to your doctor about switching to a different brand You may even consider alternate methods for birth control such as condomsHowever there are some other things to ask yourself First you used the term affection but then talked about sex Theyre not the same thing There are different kinds of intimacy and many different ways to show love for someone A book you might find useful is The Five Love LanguagesDefining what affection means to you and to him and discovering all the ways you both can show this towards each other may help lessen some of your anxiety over thisHumans are hardwired to need appropriate physical touch In fact studies have shown that newbornspremies who can receive skinonskin contact with their parent can recover faster than babies who dont receive this touch Its called Kangaroo Care Children who have grown up in neglectful environments where theyre not hugged and kissed and shown appropriate physical contact can often be unable to show this to their partners and children when theyre adults One question to ask yourself is were you having intimacy issues before starting the medication If so there may be other deeper issues at play hereFor someone who has received the wrong kind of sexualphysical touch sexual abuse physical beatings it can be difficult to allow someone to be physically close to you A therapist could help you work through thisSometimes a person may lose their sexual feelings for their partner due to issues in the relationship Once those issues are resolved the sex drive comes back Examine your relationship and see if either of you are unhappy if youve been arguing a lot or if there are any problems in your relationship that need to be addressedFinally look for the other ways that the two of you may be intimate in a nonsexual way You may be doing things for each other that you dont even realize and noticing these will help you appreciate it more Take the stress off of the sexual gratification and focus on showing your love in other ways Some people like to give gifts do the other persons chores or do other things they think the person will appreciateIf after all of this you still have a discrepancy with one of you having a higher sex drive there are many articles online that offer advice for couples dealing with this situation that you may find useful It is a very common issue for a lot of couples
"marriage work, split, lied, broke promise, cheated, upset, found out, forgot about",Do you want to be upset about a girl that he forgot about  Think about it for a minute  Do you want to measure your trust based on knowing how many female coworkers your husband has  And if so what does that say about your marriage  Trust is something that we earn based on our actions and the actions of people we interact with its also based on our ability to communicate and understand what we value and have in common  If you are focused on every little detail around your relationship it may turn into an unhealthy obsession and it may harm your relationship more   If instead you focus on opening the lines of communication let him know what you expect from him and discuss how you could both build trust again you may become closer and give your relationship the opportunity to grow  Debería este molesta porque mi esposo me mintió de nuevoEstoy tratando de hacer que mi matrimonio funcione después de una separación  Antes de separarnos el mentía mucho y rompía todas sus promesas  No creo que me haya sido infiel  El mes pasado le pregunté cuantas mujeres trabajan con él y él me dijo  Ayer me enteré que se olvido de una muchacha  Debería estar enojadaQuieres estar molesta porque se le olvido con cuantas mujeres trabaja  Piénsalo por un momento  Quieres determinar la confianza que le tienes en tu esposo basándote en su capacidad de reportar la cantidad de mujeres que trabajan con él  Si tu respuesta es sí qué refleja eso sobre tu matrimonio  La confianza es algo que se gana basado en nuestras acciones y las de aquellos con quienes interactuamos también en nuestra habilidad de comunicar y entender los valores que tenemos en común Si practicas estar preocupada por cada pequeño detalle en tu relación esto se puede convertir en una obsesión que potencialmente dañara tu relación  Si en cambio te enfocas en abrir las líneas de comunicación le dejas saber lo que esperas de él y discuten cómo pueden trabajar juntos para recuperar la confianza pueden volverse más cercanos y darse la oportunidad de que la relación crezca
"horrible, evil person, dont care enough, feeling, off day",I dont know much about the dynamics of your relationship but I want to say that you cannot possibly be responsible for anyone elses happiness  If you are interested in a good read on this topic I highly recommend The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz
"argument over finances, anger, paying for coverage, automobile insurance, giving money, making payment, realization, vehicles on policy",Id be more worried generally about a fiancee who assumes you are responsible for tracking what in fact are his responsibilities than about the anger per seWhat you describe holds the seeds of classic abusive behavior which is blaming the partner for what in fact are the persons own responsibilitiesStart by withdrawing yourself from paying his billsIf he is on his own in terms of tracking what and when is due regarding his auto policy then surely the only one for him to blame will be himselfStay clear of involving yourself in doing favors for him if the favor involves something that he is the one accountableTell him it is so the relationship remains fair for each of you
"masturbation problem, porn problem, daily masturbation, lying in bed sleeping, sex once a week, rough, worries about his needs, never touches me, treats me like a porn star, finish on my face or chest",The comments here from the other therapists are spot on As a Certified Sex Addiction TherapistCandidate Im convinced your partners acting out creates trauma for you Your partners addiction is NOT your fault and his recovery IS his responsibility Whats paramount is for you to get immediate help from an experienced therapist who understands trauma as result of the partnersspouses problematic sexual behaviors Your needs safety and the establishment of reasonable boundaries is vital to your wellbeing I wish you the very bestResources for Your Consideration 1 httpswwwiitapcom 2 httpswwwsanonorg 3 httpwwwcosarecoveryorg
"rejected, frustrated, love, struggling",Feeling rejected and frustrated is a reasonable reaction to your experience with your husband I want to encourage you that his actions may have little to do with you and regardless of outcomes I hope you find the help you need to process through your pain and still have hope for your marriage   If your husband was to work with me Id explore with him his understanding of and experience with intimacy in relationship with others Furthermore like other male clients of mine Id challenge your husband to secure an updated full medical exam from his PCP primary care physician andor urologist in order to identify or rule out any organic issues which may be causing his apparent lack of desire for sexual intimacy If there are no physical issues per se I would encourage your husband to process further his family of origin storyline regarding rules roles sex and sexuality along with working through his sexual and trauma histories
"fatigued, losing weight, distant, sexually selfish, argument, late stage stomach cancer, wont treat",I wonder if both you and your boyfriend could have a conversation about what you both want wish for and desire from one another right now That doesnt necessarily mean that your partner will give everything that you ask for but this is one of the ways that he can learn more about what would help you through this and you can learn how you could support him since traditional medical treatment is not something he wantsYou may also consider using some openended questions not yes or no answers to talk about what youre feeling about both about his cancer and about your relationship Both of you may discuss different ways that you would like support from one anotherI would also see if he was comfortable with you disclosing this to one or a few of your close friends with him considering doing the same so that you both have support that includes each other and also includes others because there may be days when you both have a negatively emotional day at the same time and would benefit from talking with someone elseIt may also be a matter of conversation to discuss what makes you happy together and use those positive moments to help move through more difficult ones
"jealous person, relationship, issues, get over, emotions, symptoms, situations",It may be important to look at this as getting through something rather than getting over it If youre aware of the reasons why you are jealous I dont know if they relate to this relationship or a previous one but you could remind yourself of the differences if your feelings of jealousy relate to something from your pastAlso it may be beneficial to have a conversation with your childs father if you are both open to having a discussion about this in a way that you summarize what each other is saying so you are sure that you are understanding each other at least to some degreeAlso consider what you may want from your childs father to assist you with this You cannot make him do anything to support you with this but you can certainly askWhat is something you could start or stop doing to move you toward your goal
"early 20s, seeing boyfriend, sweetest guy, hurtful, comments, Tumblr girl, squats",My first thought was that I wondered what changed recently Is he open to having a discussion about this so you can ask questions such as that oneIts possible that he does not understand the degree to which it hurts youTry asking if there is a time that would be good to have a discussion that is important I dont know how well the two of you have communicated over the last year but if you are concerned about this turning into an argument you may consider asking him to just listen to your point of view and see if he is able to summarize it correctly Then you can listen to his side of the concern
"jealous, afraid, reconnect, talk, avoids, worry",Talking about it would probably be helpful if youre both in a place where you can decide when is best to talk about something that is important It may also be helpful to ask if you could talk for two or three minutes to make a point and then have space for her to talk for the same amount of time You can adjust the timing for what works for both of you After one of you is talking perhaps you could restate what you have heard the person say This can lessen confusionI know you say that she avoids it It might be a good place to start talking about it  to see what makes her avoid it It could be that she thinks any discussion about them is going to lead to an argument or you saying that she cant talk to them I dont know how you typically react when you are jealous but if you can discuss talking about this in a way that you are both open to hearing what the other person is experiencing that may be helpful as well
"Nothing we've tried, has worked, so far",Sexual attraction is often discussed on a continuum If you are saying that you are not attracted to your girlfriend you could try changing what you do during sexual intimacy You could also try slowly using nonsexual touch and discussing what you each like and would prefer to do more of compared to what is not as desirable After doing this for nonsexual touching it can also be used with sexual touching Looking at more of what you like or would like to feel may be of help
"emotions: none
symptoms: none
situations: works with a man, looks at guys, check her out",I wonder if you are having some of these thoughts related to something that has neither happened directly to you in your past or to someone that you care about This can often change the way that we look at different situations Try to look at what feelings for you when you notice that someone is checking her out and perhaps when you have felt these feelings beforeIf you trust your girl enough to have an open conversation perhaps you could ask her whether she is willing to talk about something that is important to you Then you could talk about feelings that youre having
"lonely, love, intimacy, sex, bothers, close friends, not helping, thought",First things first  Friendships that develop in times of struggle may be a great emotional support but also become confusing theres sexual attraction And entertaining a tough is only going to make it a stronger target  Careful with that friendship You do not want to fill your marriages void with another person  Even when you are in a friend zone and not having intimacy with this person you may be developing a special bond sharing interest and activities that may lead to a deeper connection  Ask yourself how you would feel if your spouse was having a friendship like thatThen try to refocus on your marriage I suggest being transparent and talking to your wife about your feelings and concerns  Ask her what you could do to reconnect make some suggestions and dedicate time to practice them  Make time in both of your schedules make an effort to have lunch together or to text during the day  Remember that a marriage is like a very good friendship with benefits but sometimes the responsibility kills the funCómo puedo volver a enamorarme de mi esposaMi esposa trabaja tarde casi todos los días la amo con todo mi corazón pero no siento la intimidad como antes  Ya no tenemos sexo lo cual me molesta tremendamente  Me he acercado a una amistad del trabajo lo cual no ayuda  Nada pasara pero hay pensamientos al respectoPrimero lo primero Las amistades que se desarrollan en momentos de crisis pueden ser un gran apoyo emocional pero también pueden convertirse en algo nebuloso cuando hay atracción sexual Entretener pensamientos al respecto solo lo va a hacer un reto más grande  Ten cuidado con esa amistad No quieres llenar el vacío que deja tu matrimonio con esta nueva persona  Aunque no estés teniendo intimidad con esa persona puedes estar creando una conexión especial compartiendo intereses en común y actividades que los unen más aun Pregúntate como te sentirías si tu esposa tuviera una amistad asíIntenta reenfocarte en tu matrimonio  Sugiero que seas transparente con tu esposa y le dejes saber tu preocupación y como te sientes con el distanciamiento  Pregúntale que le gustaría hacer para reconectarse sugiérele algunas ideas y dediquen tiempo a las mismas  Hagan tiempo en sus agendas para ustedes hagan un esfuerzo para almorzar juntos y comunicarse durante el día aunque sea con textos  Recuerda que el matrimonio es como una muy buena amistad con beneficios y muchas veces las responsabilidades matan la diversión
"boyfriend of eight years, father of our two children, truck driver, never home, contributes financially, lack of support, comes home, sleeps, gives money, leaves again, unable to do anything, lack of quality time with kids",After eight years and two childrens people change  I suggest to talk to him about how you feel let him know that although he is gone for a long time his presence as a husband and father are required and important  Ask him if he will be willing to engage again and how he would like to do so  Many times when the dads are away moms design a perfect routine and they feel like they will disturb it  Make alone time and family time for him so you can reconnect as a couple and then as a familyCómo trabajo con un esposo que solo contribuye económicamenteMi novio de ocho amos y padre de mis dos hijos es camionero El nunca está en casa y solo contribuye financieramente No provee apoyo en ninguna otra forma El viene a casa cuando puede duerme provee dinero y se va otra vez No puedo lograr que haga nada conmigo y los niños Solo duerme y trabajaDespués de ocho años y dos hijos las  personas cambian  Te sugiero que hables con tu pareja sobre cómo te dientes déjale saber que aunque el esta fuera la mayoría del tiempo su presencia como pareja y padre es requerida e importante Pregúntale si el está dispuesto a comprometerse  ser parte activa de la familia y como lo haría  Muchas veces cuando los papás están afuera las mamás desarrollan rutinas que luego ellos no quieren interrumpir  Crea tiempo a solas para dedicarle a el para que puedan reconectar como pareja y luego como familia
"jealousy, feelings, relationship problems, afraid, messing up, stupid",Trust is at the top of what makes a healthy relationship  It sounds like you may benefit from personal counseling to explore where this jealousy comes from and what keeps you from having complete trust in your boyfriend  This is not stupid this is your mind telling you that there is something that needs to be worked through  Sometimes we need to talk to someone like a counselor who is disconnected from our life to understand our feelings and what they mean in our relationships
"dating for two months, heavy past, angry, penalize, things I did before I met him",Not in my book Youre only two months in At this early stage this is a bit of a warning sign If he cant accept or feel comfortable with who you are and decisions youve made theres already a level of discomfort here that shouldnt be ignored No he doesnt have the right to penalize you or punish you not just for past thingsnot for anything What he does get to do it tell you how it affects him Sureif he feels uncomfortable or needs reassurancelisten to those things But If he doesnt dig who you are maybe he can walk the other way
"emotions, hurt, love, blunt, hurtful words, feeling, midlife crisis",I get it Your husband tells you that hes not in love with you but oops hes changed his mind and will tolerate you for a while longer Excuse me My Dear its okay if you expect more than that from a marriage Maybe the question has shifted from whether he is happy in the marriage to whether you are happy in the marriage You say you love this man  who makes you feel like nothing I say it might be time to sit down with an individual therapist and look objectively at your marriage and whether its working for you
"rejected, thinking, married the wrong person, intimate things, early in the relationship, agreed to try, all day",Id say youre letting fear get a hold on you You would really enjoy some sexual activities that your wife hasnt initiated in a long while but its a big leap to go from that to I married the wrong person Fear is telling you that she doesnt respect or like or want you Look at the bigger picture What is the evidence that your wife wants to please youthat she is the right woman for youthat she loves youthat she cares about whats important to you  If there is evidence there then you owe it to the marriage to rein in your fearful thoughtsTalking to your wife is so important right now We all have moments when we really just want to sit and stew in our self pity over our partner not vacuuming or cooking or saying loving things often enoughbut they cant read our minds Can you lovingly let her know what you miss what you hope forwhat you need This is the meat of a loving relationship Sharing who we are so that we can love each other better Your wife deserves the benefit of the doubt that shell listen to what you long for Can you risk feeling vulnerable You cant control her answer but can you trust her to care
"cheat, argue, kiss, unprotected sex, one time thing, never see them twice","Hello and thank you for your question The question about
whether or not to cheat is based on personal values that can only be answered
by you However here are a few things to consider and questions to ask
yourself to help you find your answer
1    
Do you feel like you are violating your own
values or morals This is important because we all have different values and
morals surrounding sex love and monogamy If you value monogamous
relationships and find yourself cheating on your partner then you may feel
like you are living in contradiction to your values and most people are not
happy when they do that However if monogamy is not something you value then
perhaps it is time to reevaluate the relationship and determine if it is still
right for you Not all people want monogamous relationships and that
is alright Finally if you value your husbands feelings and know that the
affairs would hurt him then your behaviors may again be in contrast to your
own values That can only be determined by you 
2      Based on how you describe your relationship it
sounds like you are not very satisfied with the way it is  From the outside it looks like the affairs
are a way to get even with your husband or to feel better after an argument This
is something that can happen when mutual respect starts to fade in a
relationship and gets replaced with contempt We can simply stop caring about
how our actions hurt each other or potentially hurt each other Perhaps the
question to ask here is when you look out toward the future with your husband
is this the pattern that you want to keep The pattern of very little sex
argument and then satisfying the pain or dissatisfaction with affairs 
 3      What are your goals for this relationship If we
start to become disconnected in a relationship we can begin to do things on
autopilot Get up get the kids up go to work come home and go to bed None
of which requires any intimacy at all Are you still able to see the hopes and
dreams you once had for this relationship
 4     
Have you considered seeking marital counseling Not
having affairs wont actually fix the part of the relationship that is leading
you to have them If there is something broken it sometimes requires some help
to get it fixed 
 Hopefully these questions and thoughts will help you come to
some kind of conclusion about what is right for you and your relationship I certainly
wish you well

"afraid of having sex, disappointing my partner, inexperienced, not a virgin, scared, disappointed with my naked body, think differently of me",These fears are completely normal Almost everyone has the same fears you do to some degree especially if they lack experience Men also feel far more of these fears than you realize That can helpto remember that were all a little scared and looking for safety and approvalYou mention a partner but Im not sure if you currently have one Having a partner you can trust with your fears and who you feel safe with is so important When youre really confident someone cares deeply for you this can help the fears to go away or diminish How well do you know your own body Getting to know how you like to be touched and how different touches feelgetting acquainted with your body yourself firstthis can help build sexual confidence In general our partners care less about our fat and wrinkles than they care about how we make them feel in bed Being a generous lover who is confident enough to put fear asideironically this is what makes you good in bed But be patient with yourself Your confidence will grow with experience and that doesnt have to happen until you are ready Theres not rush
"guilty, not guilty, emotions, feelings, married, sex, friend, body, rights",I dont think theres anything that youre supposed to feel Some people feel tremendously guilty when they cheat and others not at all It could be that your partner doesnt know about the cheating and you havent had to face hisher emotions and reactions When something we do is hiddena secretits easier to avoid feeling guilty I wonder if youre avoiding your own emotions But lets put that question aside for now There are better questionsWhat do you want Do you want your marriage If not this may be why you dont feel guilty Do you want to be able to sleep with your friend Its unlikely that both are possible keeping the marriage and the affair Yes you get to do whatever you want with your bodyandthere may be consequences Affairs almost always get discovered Who do you want to be What kind of partner do you want to be What might your partner feel if they knew How might you feel then Would you care Has something happened thats affected how much you care about your partnerI suggest that these other questions might be a place to start Exploring it with a therapist is something to consider maybe I wish you the best as you sort it out
"trust issues, affect my relationship, end it sooner, cant",If you thing your trust issues are going to end or affect your relationship it will because you are being baggage from your parents into this relationship  Dont allow their problems to become your problem  You didnt mention that your partner in your present relationship have done anything to make you not trust them  Like in the court of law if no evidencefind not guilty  Dont make them pay the consequences as if guilty of your parents unhealthy behavior
"first kid, sex, nonexistent, every three or four months, counseling, come around, intimately lonely, move on, hurting my kids",Hi Pocahontas This is a painful situation When youre in a relationship you assume that you will continue to receive warmth and affection When it dries up its a very lonely place Its possible that there is an unaddressed issue in the relationship Its also possible that your partner has hormonal issues pain issues  sexual dysfunction or is asexual There is no one answer here Only you can decide what is right for you But let me ask some questions to help you explore next stepsAside from the sex is your wife loving and supportive What are the other ways in which you feel loved Does your wife talk to you Does she communicate her needs and desires Does she articulate what gets in the way of having sex If your wife is generally a loving open partner you use this to see that her behaviours arent personal Whether she resolves this or not it can help you to cope with the rejection This is your wifes issue and the ball is in her courtIn my opinion if couples therapy hasnt helped its time for your wife to own whatever is blocking her and address it with her physician and therapist Let her be in charge of the sex for a while to take the pressure off and she can have the time to figure out what gets in the way of having regular sexual intimacy in your relationship If you think of this as my wife is in crisis and needs support in figuring this out it can help you manage your own emotions Pressure to have sex might push her further away Did the couple therapist help you to see the dynamic in your relationship Has your partner identified something she feels she is lacking in the relationship One good way to make sure you get is to give and I mean give what she wants not sex Its appropriate to say to her now I cannot live in a relationship with so little intimacy I need for you to be honest with me about what you want for us sexually If this is all you want Im not sure I can do it If you want us to be more sexual I need you to address what gets in the way for you  Give her some time help her in any way you can and then see where you are See if she does seek help to address an issue that is hers Thenyou have a decision to make I encourage you to make it looking at the big picture not just the sex
"love, uncertainty, late teens, living together, talking to a guy friend, feeling more loved",Hi Michigan Relationships are so sparkly for a few years and then things start to feel different Most of the time this is simply because weve pulled back from all the attachmentforming behaviours we did at the beginning We stop talking a lot because we have less to discoverwe do less for each other and buy fewer giftsspend less time togetherall because we have already formed the love and attachment and we dont need to fill the gas tank as much So just because it feels different doesnt mean its gone badHaving said that it seems as though you are missing something in this relationship that you need you dont feel loved enough right now Can you tell him Have you told him The strength of your relationship is more clear when people know what the expectations are Let him know what you need and see if he gets it You have choices to make and there is no wrong choice You certainly have the right to say this isnt feeling great anymore or I want to explore other relationships and walk away But often its worth it to see how good something can be before you bail Youre drawn to someone else and this is up to you to decide how this fits with your expectations of yourself in a relationship Your interest in this other guy is sparkly and new Your boyfriend cant compete with that if he doesnt know youre unhappy For some people being drawn to someone else is a sign theyre not into their partner For others its a danger alert and it makes them want to improve their current relationship Which one are you
"own business, stays out all night, son together, stay home, complain, pregnant, moved in together, great, not spending time, doing something wrong, talked, how he is, before",Congrats on the birth of your sonYour situation sounds painful lonely and isolatingAnd these features are eating away at your selfconfidenceStart by believing in yourself  The feelings and ideas you describe here would only be arising from within you because they are at the very least partly trueAsk your boyfriend if he is willing to listen and understand your point of view  If he does then hopefully the two of you will more easily talk with one another about the truth of feeling overwhelmed by the quick pace of your courtship and becoming a familyIf these discussions continuously include him blaming you for having your own feelings and expecting him to more actively be a part of your and your sons life then youll need to start valuing your feelings and what is best for you and your son by yourselfI send you lots of good luck
"love, so much, dont know, what to do",Does he tell you a reason as to why he feels you dont love himAsk him this so you will clearly know his definition of love
"best relationship, changed, less attention, little to no intercourse, works a lot, goes to the gym a lot, no time for me, two hours from family, leave me alone, everything is okay, love this man, dont know what to do",Hello It doesnt feel good when it seems that your partner no longer cares or cares less for you especially if your feelings have not changed It can be scary frustrating and lonely Have you tried talking to him about your concerns I would suggest to start there There may be several reasons for his actions some of which may have nothing to do with how he feels for you Learning about what is going on for him will likely answer your questions and depending on his response may cause some relief When initiating conversations about subjects that are sensitive there are a few things that you want to remember Tell him how you are feeling and what you are experiencing rather than blaming him or telling him what he is doing wrong Avoid using extreme black and white language ie always and never For example you may say something such as I feel confused that we are rarely intimate and Im wondering if youve also noticed this change versus You are never intimate with me anymore Dont be afraid to ask him questions You deserve to know what is going on as his behavior is effecting your well being I like to ask openended questions instead of yes and no questions It allows for more clarity and deeper explanation Lastly ask yourself and possibly him what part you play in the recent changes Does he feel that youve been distant Does he need something from you Let him know that you are willing to work things out as a team If communication attempts fail seeing a couples therapist can be a great benefit Having an objective party to coach you through this difficut time can give you the support that will create lasting changes in your relationshipBest of luck to you
"self-esteem, alone, intimacy, shut down, affection, passive-aggressive, ignored, begging, love, happy",Hi SmyrnaYour husband is avoiding dealing with this problem I understand how lonely you must feel not only sexually but emotionally tooFrom what you describe it seems that he wants to be there for you but he clearly has barriers to engaging fully around this issue My hunch is that he doesnt know what to do or how to talk to you But I think he does have something to sayYour husband is 29 years older and youve been together for ten yearsthat puts you at around thirty perhaps and him at almost sixty Has any wise older woman sat you down to explain that men sometimes have erectile issues or hormonerelated low sex drive as they age Its possible that your husband is bewildered angry grieving or anxious about changes in his sex drive or his ability to maintain an erection and that he doesnt know how to talk to you about this He may feel like hes letting you down and hes scared it will get worse so hes sticking his head in the sand Of course that doesnt help does itThe worst case scenario is that you get angry or hopeless that he senses danger or disapproval from you and pulls away even further in shame Eventually you stop chasing him and you drift further apart Its a bit of a conundrumhow to honour both your need for connection and honesty and his need for a safe place to explore his fears and insecurities Maybe lower your expectations for a bit Your husband will need to believe that you are a safe place to share his fears and you would need to hold onto the fact that hes really scared and that hes not rejecting youjust protecting himselfI would suggest having a gentle conversation that sounds something like Sweetheart we both know that somethings not right here I think youve been trying to handle this on your own or hoping it would get better but can we agree that its not I need you to either talk to me about whats happening or please go see a doctor What I need is to see that you are doing some little step to help us Either of those things would show me thatIn the end you need to know that hes heard you and that hes willing to look at the issue in some way If he does neither then at least you know where you stand and you can decide whether to live in a sexless marriage I wonder if showing him this answer to your question might help Just a thought
"cheated on me, broke up, trust issues, make it work, getting in the way, causing problems",Hi MichiganThis is a common issue How do you trust after you know someone is capable of hurting you I totally get that its hard and I believe its worth it if you truly love and want to be with someone You can be stronger in the scarred places I would suggest that you each have a separate job to do to rebuild this trust It is definitely possible to rebuild it because anything is possible if both people want it enoughYour boyfriend came clean to youthis is pretty crucial He chose to honour your needs rather than keep the secret You can use that as evidence in your proof that he loves me file Work on that filethicken it up Having a thick he does care about me and wouldnt hurt me again file will help you Other things that he can do to help you thicken that file because after all his behaviours caused this problem answer all your questions dont brush you off if youre feeling insecure treat you as though youre a priority avoid questionable contact with other women have open communication give you passwords to devices so there is transparency He can help you to understand where those behaviours came fromwhy he cheated in the first places although people arent always good with those why questionsYou can focus on telling yourself that people change that he deserves a chance to show you he can be loyal or at least youve decided to give him that chance and that you want to be a trusting person If you act like a trusting person you will likely feel more like one Dont go snooping dont interrogate him Its normal you might feel scared and try to tell him that when you do Let him know what happens that leads to you feeling scaredThis is a start for you A good therapist can be helpful too
"love, friend, girl, fell in love, first love, talk, phone, Facebook, feelings, touch, dreams, broken, relationship, guy, be in love",It all depends how old you are and what a particular situation is  You may be feeling very close to this friend and mistake that feeling for sexual feeling or the feelings may be real This is something you will find out for yourself however it definitely doesnt mean that you are a lesbian just because you have those feelings for this particular person Time will tell but if you need to discuss this you could see your school councelor if you are at schooluniversity or find a LGBT group with meetings and discuss this with them I hope this is helpful
"embarrassing, antisocial, partner, family, friends, social",Hi Buffalo I think youre right your partners reactions are about him I have to say its a cruel thing to say to someone you lovethat youre embarrassed by them The subtext says Youre not good enough and I love that you can reject that false messageYou dont have to be different for anyone If he cant accept you for who you are what is he doing with you Your social habits unless they are extremelike you refuse to go anywhere arent a reflection on him its just you being you Also and Im sure youve found thisthe more he judges you the more difficult it is for you to be the confident outgoing person he wants you to beso his method of trying to change you doesnt even workI think thats the cruxhes trying to change you What does that make you want to do
"paranoid, being, know",Hi TexasOh thats a powerful idea isnt it It burrows into your head Lets figure this out First has your partner given you any concrete reason not to trust them Have they cheated before If not then they deserve the benefit of the doubt until there is evidence If its a yes then its natural that these fears would be triggered and you can simply let your partner know what triggers the fear and what you need When you refuse to let me see your phone I worry that youre hiding something I need openness If they havent cheated on you in the past there are three possible scenarios here I invite you to take a moment and write down what the evidence is that cheating is going on What is the specific thing thats triggering your fears When you have your data recorded read onThe first scenario is that you have been personally hurt in the past by someone else and youve developed fears that you will be hurt again or that youre not enough to keep someone interested this is just fearpeople cheat for their own reasons not because were not interesting This may be true if what you wrote down is They didnt really do anything wrongthere is no evidence Im just scared and suspicious Thats a cue to do some self reflection and calm yourself with thoughts like nothing has really happened I can trustIf what you wrote down was vague evidence like for example your partner has been distant or irritable or youre having less sex than usual you can try to approach the situation without making assumptions Trust your gut but your gut isnt seeing evidence of cheatingits evidence of something Ask your partner whats up with accusations or assumptionsThe third possibility is that there is some clear evidence that they are cheating Maybe there are texts on a phone or someone has told you something they saw Id say when there is some evidence its okay to present this to your partner and ask whats going on If this happens repeatedly and your gut is screaming and there are only excuses or explanations that dont make sense then its okay to do a bit of research and be extra aware of whats going on around you I hope that helps
"amazing relationship, connection, committed, planning a very long life together, open and honest, not interested in having sex, past relationships, get over",I wonder how long anymore will be for your boyfriendSince you both are planning a long life together instead of his custom of ending relationships when he feels bored with the sex he will be facing the situation of being in a relationship and not having sex with his partner to whom he is committedWhat are your own views on the meaning of sex in a relationshipKnowing this will help you be better able to collaborate with your boyfriend on finding ways of balancing what you each would like
"emotions, transparent, honest, bad, desire, orgasmed, terrible, fears, cheat, cried, frustrated, love, baby",That sounds really challenging for both of you Differences in sexual desire between partners is common and can create real friction and conflict I would encourage you to do some couples counselling or sex therapy as often these issues can be worked through and low sexual desire can result from relational fears and misunderstandings or sex that isnt as arousing as is possible There are some good videos on this resource page about sexuality and intimacy and a video that specifically addresses desire differences in relationships
"arguments, break up, clicked, married, problems, sex, pictures, affair, thinking, click, liked, never be together",If you will never be together and in order to maintain this affair you need to deceive both of your spouses it seems unlikely that maintaining the affair will bring anything but heartbreak for everyone involved There is obviously something that you are getting from this that you are not getting in your marriage Maybe this is a cue that there is work to do on your marriage to try to make it more fulfilling and if that is not possible then maybe you want something else for your life  If you and your husband are willing I would encourage you to do some therapy or counselling together  You may enjoy this article to learn a little more about some factors that lead to connection or disconnection and that predict separation and divorce
"expresses how much he cares, loves me, best relationships, lied to me, hiding something, lying about something, hid text messages, claimed she was a friend, friendly conversation, found interest in, exgirlfriend, fake contact name, friendly, lied to my face, never cheated, expresses his love, wants to change, do better",New York New Yorkits not your boyfriends lying that concerns me the most its the lies you tell yourself Verbal expressions are easy but its walking the walk thats more important in the end When someone shows you what theyre capable of you can believe them Hes capable of being manipulative and deceitful and he even lies as hes telling you hell stop lying What youre doing is called denial when you see evidence of something but you choose not to believe the evidence He might love you with his heart but love in the end is a verb and is based on respectful loving behaviours My wish is that you start by believing in what you deserve
"cheating on him, moved out, previous problems, issue, move on, sign contract, healthy relationship, walk away",Hi Dallas While I think its healthy for both members of a couple to have things that they need from each other and to talk about that your situation sounds onesided and rigid Will you have a list too There are elements of control here humiliating you in front of coworkers saying you have to sign the contract before you can move forwarddoes he decide when you move in and out Your passive aggressive communications with the other man and your difficulty in knowing what direction you want also hint that maybe you dont have a voice in this relationship Do you have a voice If you are uncomfortable with the contract are you listening to your own voice If you cant hear your own voice maybe its time to sit down with a therapist and strengthen yourself so you can at least know what you feel and wantNo relationship is all good or all bad wouldnt that make it easy Relationships dont come with billboards that tell us what to do They dont come with crystal balls that tell us what will happen except that past behaviour is a good predictor You have everything you need in order to make the best decision for you right now except clarity and his control may be what is making things muddy for you Youre too busy blaming yourself to see the situation clearly A therapist can help you stop blaming yourself and see what your situation is
"betrayal, heartbreak, insecurity, suspicion, emotional pain, lingering feelings, past relationship, trust issues",Your sense of hurt is very understandableDo you and your boyfriend have an agreement on looking through each others phonesI ask because the overall problem sounds like lack of trust and that there may be a difference in what each of you wants and expects from your relationshipProbably if the two of you talk about these topics and you each become clear as to the commitment status of each of you to the other youll have more clarity as to what either of you would like from the otherWith this new level of clarity his  past relationship involvements will likely be less meaningful Once you have clear definition of the two of you as a couple who he was as a past partner to someone else will matter very little
"married for 20 years, cheated, hid my cheating, life stress, depressed, pushed him out",Do you both want to fix the marriageThe relationship belongs to both of you so that one working without the other cooperating in this work too will have one person who does all the changingThis dynamic itself creates problems of its ownAbout your husband telling you he feels pushed out did he do anything on his own to address his problem of feeling like thisAll you state is that he blames you for creating a situation he didnt likeIf he did nothing because he felt unsure what to do anything which shows he understands he has as vital a part in the marriage as you is okBecause affairs create mistrust between two people the two of you would also need to be very aware to regain each others trustTalking as much as possible so you both know what goes on in the life of the other how you each are feeling what matters to you is helpful to grow a new foundation for your marriages future
"hate cats, grosses me out, very upset, jealous",Sorry for you and sorry for the cat because youre each in a tense positionWhat was the context of your boyfriend adopting a cat since he was aware that this would likely cause problems in the relationship with youIf you dont already know his answer then find out  Doing so will tell you a lot about your boyfriends expectations about you  Does he expect you to accept without question whatever he does  Does he care about your views  Does a cat have some deep meaning for him that having one is essential to his life and he never told you soPlease dont be mean to the cat  Its not the cats fault for being in your boyfriends careThere are plenty of other cats on this earth so throwing out the cat will not solve anything between you and your boyfriendWho knows your boyfriend may come back home with three more catsStart with a conversation about your feelings and his interest in your feelings
"feelings, intimacy issues, in love, attracted romantically, platonic love, cares, family, marriage, friendship, coworker, free time",Hi PortlandThis must feel like your world is turned upside down for your wife to declare her confusion followed closely by resignation followed closely by a new friend I get how upsetting this isIf I was your therapist Id want to explore this a good deal because there are several possibilities concerning what might be happening Be careful not to jump to conclusions Sometimes people have been slowly falling out of love for a long time and often this is due to some perhaps unnamed unmet need in the marriage She may have been coming to this point over a period of time and has only finally said so Its also possible that your wife is going through some temporary crisisshes changing and personally unhappy and blaming the marriage for it Only she can help herself through this she could get the help of a therapist but its not your place to tell her to do this Or its possible shes met this new friend and her attachment to him has clouded her view or clarified something for her  Right now its important that you respect your wifes decision to separate if shes asking for that We cant trap people in a marriage If she needs separation or distance then its respectful to give her thatThat doesnt mean that you have to give up on the marriage right now I would seek the support of a therapist who can help you sort out what YOU want whether its to move on with your life or wait patiently for a period of time I cant predict what will happen here But you can find out what the best path for you is I wish you the best
"lonely, no friends, invisible, bothering people, feel invisible, wants to be around",A lot of times any and each of us creates what we need for ourselves by seeing other people as creating these circumstances and situationsIs it possible that at this time period in your life being alone is positive for sorting through your true values or sorting through key situations in your lifeIf yes then possibly you are giving yourself some alone time even though to some degree being alone is not your first choiceAt the very least since you arent happy with being the one who texts others then some alone time may encourage new thoughts and ideas creating more open space within you to attract other people who do enjoy texting you firstAlso most relationships are not forever  Is it possible you are at a phase when some relationships are simply closing down so that you have clear space within your life for new and different activity
"love, hate, penetration, crying, dont like, enjoy",Although I am not entirely sure why you might be struggling in this area an initial question I have is do you want to be sexually active at this time or is this something that you feel pressured into doing  If you feel pressured into being sexually active by your friends or boyfriend it is understandable that you want it to be over  I would encourage you to ask your boyfriend to be patient with you at this time  until you figure out what is going on  I encourage you to then think very deeply about what your reservations if any  about being sexually active  Do you fear pregnancy  Are there problems in the relationship  Are you afraid of the emotional intimacy Another question that comes to mind is whether or not you have any history of sexual activity that you did not consent to that might be getting in the way   When these types of traumatic events occur  people can essentially become triggered negatively by anything that reminds them of past trauma  Such events can cause an aversion to sex even if there is now a loving relationship whom one wants to be sexually active with  If this is the case I strongly recommend individual therapy to begin working through some of these issues A final area that you might explore would be whether or not you are experiencing pain with penetration  If so I would recommend that you schedule an appointment with a gynecologist to rule out any type of medical issues that might be causing these problems  Although pain can also be associated with emotional issues it is always good to rule out possible physical causes  I hope that these ideas help to point you in the right direction  Take care
"trust issues, new guy friend, texting, calling, investigated, gay, fighting, trust",Hello Being unable to trust your significant other certainly can cause one to feel unsettled Has your spouse ever done anything questionable that would cause you to not trust her If so then it will take time and some work to gain the trust back Couples counseling would be of benefit If not then you may want to consider seeing a therapist on your own in order to better learn where your insecurities come from There are several possible reasons why you may be feeling insecure but without knowing them the issue is not likely to get resolved In the meantime I suggest that when youre feeling upset and are unable to trust what your wife saysdoes think before you speak Ask yourself if you have valid reasons to not trust her Instead of arguing try and communicate how youre feeling and let her know that resolving this trust issue will be a top priority for you so that you can focus on other aspects of your relationship Hope it all works out for you both

"crave attention, companionship, sex, hysterectomy, bad knee",Hi HamptonAlthough Id bet your wife also wants the attention and companionship it seems that there are a few barriers in your sexual relationship right now I also would bet that there are things that your wife would like from you This is a very common issue two people with different sexual drives or needs If you both want the relationship to improve a couples therapist who works in sexuality is a great idea its a complex picture that youve only given us a glimpse ofIn the meantime you can try a few things have compassion for your wife Shes in pain and this may preoccupy her Sex may be uncomfortable for her She needs understanding You need understanding too right  Help her to see that youre not just angry but lonely and hurt it might affect how you see yourself as a man Showing her irritability or anger might push her farther awayThere are many ways to be close intimate and sexual that dont involve intercourse You might want to explore some of these things and reassure her that you wont pressure her to have intercourse Find out what your wifes wishes and ideas are You might be surprisedThese things take time to address especially if theyve been years in the making I do recommend seeing that therapist Relationships are very complex and it takes time to explore all the layers and barriers to change Best of luck
"emotions, lack of trust, insecurities, physical abuse, separation, secret relationship, confess, love triangle, affairs, hurt, shock, decision-making, torn apart, flying out",Hi Jayuya Im struggling in this moment with my own biases I have biases that are about respect and every individuals need for and right to respect Your husband lies cheats and physically hurts you He makes excuses and blames you for these behaviours and trains you to do the same He demonstrates many controlling and abusive behaviours And now in an attempt to manipulate and silence you he wants to have his cake and eat it too and suggests you should share him There arent many crumbs of this cake left for you are thereSo my biases about respect dont make me want to rescue you or tell you what to do I cant do that and I dont think either of those things will help you Id like to ask you some questions thoughAre you happy Do you know what happy is Do you know what respect is Are your children safe Are your children witnessing violence because if they are then theyre not safe Do you have supports Do your family and friends know whats happening in your life Have you ever been to a womens shelter Are you willing to sit down in an office with a professional who can help you think clearly Thats what I suggest These are big decisions you deserve some support I wish you the best
"married, husband, kids, accepts, thankful, loves, problems, relationship, past, trust, love, tired",Hi LouisianaYou say that the problems are with your past but my hunch is the problems are about his insecurity and his personal barriers to trust unless youve recently revealed details of a sordid past You dont mention ever having hurt the trust in the relationshipTrust is the first stage in a relationship Moving forward before they develop trust is a common mistake couples make and now you two have involved children in a relationship thats missing a crucial element But you didnt see this coming did you Thats because only as we become emotionally intimate do our deeper fears and insecurities come to the surface I give you credit for wanting it to work and I believe you would benefit from the support of a therapist in working through the kinks related to trust Good luck
"emotions, wanting, drives me crazy, scared, hurt, removed, testicles, make love, touch, get close",Are you talking with your boyfriend about his doctor advises on starting to have sex againBeing able to talk together about topics that involve both of you will establish a new type of intimacy on an emotional levelAlso there are many ways of making love  If your bfs cyst hasnt yet healed then another way of both increasing your emotional intimacy and learning different love making suggestions is to read about these together with himI hope the two of you enjoy learning new ways of sexually taking care of one another while developing more emotional closeness in the process
"cheated on, obsessing, cheating, full access, obsessed, constantly checking, driving a wedge",Hi Greenville I respect that youre owning your own overreactions and that you want to give your boyfriend the respect he deserves The truth is that some people cheat and some dont and our partners deserve the benefit of the doubt unless they show signs they cant be trustedThe answer here is in two different areas Basically if you want to feel differently more trusting in your case you look at your thoughts and your behavioursYour thoughts are stuck like tires in deep ruts in the road These thoughts are only habits they dont reflect the truth Fear is probably whispering in your ear things like everyone cheats or  youre not enough for him Once you figure out what fear is trying to tell you picture those words in red next time they come up Ask yourself what the evidence is that supports that thought there wont be muchperhaps none and what is the evidence that doesnt support it I know lots of good men I know I deserve love and loyalty there is no sign of infidelity Youre learning to refute the thoughts that are connected to the fear Thats the first half Practise these thoughtsThe rest of the work is in your behaviours Act as though you trust him Force yourself to not check or interrogate and the less you check the less obsessive and untrusting you will feel Acting as if something if true strangely helps us believe itIts possible to change the way we think and this is turn changes the way we feel Try this to start and see a therapist for support and cognitive behavioural therapy if you want to dive more deeply into why this is happening and how to stop it Good luck
"neglects his family, find a babysitter, rarely comes to bed, never have date nights",Hi Ohio The crazy things about situations like this is that almost guaranteed while your husband is out working and away from home he feels hes doing it all for you and the kids he believes hes loving you He might feel like hes carrying his family on his shoulders Your love language is differentyoud rather spend time with him or talk to himyou want to feel like hes a bigger part of the family and feel connected to him I absolutely understand that and I support you asking for thatHe might very well miss that feeling of connectedness too but hes likely also feeling the weight of financial responsibility A lot of men and women dont talk about this but they feel it Sometimes they feel like they cant win either way theres pressure to earn and pressure to be home He has needs too he probably wants more appreciation and less blame I urge you to talk to him about how you feel find out how hes feeling and use a professional to assist you if your communication styles arent great Right now you WANT to spend time with him and that tells me that you have a good chance of addressing this problem successfully
"thoughts, stop, emotions",The thoughts you are having are just thoughts  Not actions  It is your choice whether you act on these thoughts  If you decide to explore having sex with adults of different genders that is great  If you find yourself obsessed with sexual thoughts you may want to see a cognitivebehavioural therapist  Take care
"erection problems, desire for a woman, frustrated, suggestions, Doc doesnt want to discuss",When a doc blows you off it may be a signal that it is time to find a new one ED can often be caused by health issues If all physical possibilities are ruled out then its time to look within and enlist the help of a sex therapist Heres a good article for you to start with
"lack of libido, anxiety medication, diminished libido, lack of intimacy, romance, hectic schedule, fake orgasm, honest conversation, lying, spiraling sex life",You are newly married you Have a hectic schedule your wife is on anti anxiety medication What if you take the focus hint pressure off of her orgasms and focus instead on connecting with one another You know like the gestures you each likely made while dating  It turns out that these little moments of connection throughout our days are actually foreplay Spend a few weeks making a real effort to focus on building up your little daily moments of connection I wrote a post about this a while back you can find it here httpconnectfulnesscomlittlemoments And have fun with it
"love, once per month, normal",To begin with whats normal for one couple isnt going to be normal for the next every couple has their own normal and thats important to keep in mind Your sexual lives will ebb and flow What Id be more curious about is the quality rather than the quantity of the sex you are having Id also want you both to refocus on building up your little daily moments of connection I wrote a post about exactly that a while back and you can find it here
"sex, think of other men, want other men, married, together, 14 years",Sustaining passion in marriage is tough stuff Its a relatively modern dilemma you are facing with perhaps unrealistic expectations of what marriage should be It sounds like your definitions of love and sexual passion have merged together thats both common and confusing Intimacy and sexuality within your marriage are bound to ebb and flow Resparking your passion will involve growing Using your sexual drama and fantasies as windows into discovering your needs security and wants desires Marriage is a people growing process you mature into one another and to achieve fulfillment your continued development will be required
"weird fetish, afraid, open up, what should I do",This is difficult to answer because you dont tell us what the fetish is  I do understand that this is something that is bothering you though The first thing to ask yourself is if this is something that is illegal or not  If this is illegal to engage in then you need to seek counseling help immediately to control the urgesHowever if your fetish is not something illegal and you just feel that it is something odd a therapist could still help you deal with these feelings  You may find that it is something very common and not something to be ashamed of  You may find other people have the same interest as you  Find a therapist that you can trust and tell them  Dont hold back with your therapist  Trust me they have heard and seen it all by now and they can help you either stop the behavior that is causing you distress or help you come to terms with accepting the behavior as part of who you are  There is no need to suffer with this alone
"promiscuous past, boyfriend, can't get over, loves me, disgusting, sexual distraction, more sex, different people, handle",I am sorry to hear of your relationship struggles One thing I wonder is did you volunteer the information about your past or is this something that he asked about In the future it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this I think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history For one thing it is a good idea to be checked for STDs before entering into a sexual relationship with someone and it is fair to share that information with each other Partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you dont like to do This gets into a gray area for some people I dont necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and I certainly dont want a whole lot of details Sometimes that is an image I just dont want in my head about my partner Vague details are usually enoughHowever I understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past This is a reflection on him not you This shows insecurities on his part You cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information The past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future If he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship You can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you I have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity It takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though If your boyfriend cannot get over your past you may have to let him go Dont keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you Constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low selfesteem due to this type of treatment I dont see that you have done anything wrong If you arent cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly how he handles that information is on him Ultimately relationships have a tendency to come and go Dont fight to hold onto someone who is not right for you It is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you can be In time the right person for you will enter your life
"medical issues, no sex drive, shut down, closed everyone out, divorce, devastated, seeing someone else, work things out, not sure, jealous, serious",Im sorry to hear about your current situation My heart goes out to you during this timeFirst of all it is of vital importance that you discuss your symptoms with your doctor Regardless of whether you are able to mend your relationship with your husband you need to address the physical issues you are experiencing More than likely heshe will be able to help you relieve some of these symptomsSecondly you must be upfront and honest with your husband Intimacy is a large part of a relationship and it is unfair to your husband that you did not disclose how you were feeling I think he would appreciate knowing that it was your medical problems causing the lack of sexual desire as opposed to the reason being himIf you explain to him that you are addressing your sexual issues with your doctor in order to enhance your relationship he may be more willing to see that you are serious in wanting to mend the relationship The conversation will be hard to explain to your doctor and your husband since it is of such a personal nature but it will be extremely beneficial And please note that the reason for the feelings you were experiencing or lack thereof was not your faultBest of luck to you and your husband
"lost my grandpa, rough time, deal with the loss, need some help, pay for counseling, where can I get help",If you connect with your therapist and can say whatever you want to say and not be judged If you feel like things situations your outlook are shifting for you
"passed away, memories, crying, can't sleep, tears, waterfalls, emotions",Its good to know you are reminiscing about good memories  The sadness and crying is normal when you are missing a loved one  You are noticing that grief changes it doesnt just stop  You have recognized that there will be moments in life that you will want to have shared with your brother and grandma and it just seems unfair that you cannot  I often find that when someone is stuck in the place you are it is a result of unfinished business and in your case it appears unfinished futures  A professional versed in grieving and its intricacies can guide you to navigate through this and lessen the intensity that you experience  As life goes on there will be many moments that you will have wished they were present but those moments do not have to bring you such intense emotion  Seek some help you wont regret it
"hopeless, sadness, lost, relationship issues, not close",I am so sorry about your loss  Losing someone you love is always difficult however losing a mother is a significant loss in a daughters life  What makes this loss complicated is that it appears you have also had a loss in your relationship with your sister  It is difficult to know what happened with your sister with the limited information you have provided but what I suspect is that there are some unresolved issues between the two of you and that she may be projecting her pain on to you  It is important to remember that your sister is also grieving the loss of your mother and may not be dealing with it in a very healthy way  By her bringing up your relationship with your mother and suggesting that you were never close to her is her opinion  Only you can define and determine what your relationship was like with your mother  If there is truth to this then it may be something you may need to talk about with a counselor   There could be an added layer of ambiguous loss in that you are not only grieving her physical absence but could be grieving the loss of a relationship you wish you could have had with her and the realization that you never will  You and your sister are both in the heart of the grieving cycle  When two people are grieving the same loss at the same time it is difficult to provide support to each other because of their own struggle even if they both were on good terms with each other  Depression is part of the cycle of grief  It is absolutely normal to feel sad as well as experiencing other depressive symptoms ie feelings of isolation lack of motivation low energy sleep or appetite changes etc  Anger is another phase of the grief cycle  Your sister may be stuck in the anger phase not wanting to connect with her own feelings of sadness so this may be why she is being hurtful towards you in projecting her anger onto you in order to avoid the vulnerability of experiencing her own griefFinally it appears that your depression proceeded the loss of your mother and is making your experience with grief more complicated  Were you officially diagnosed and treated for depression prior to your loss  Depression in grief is different than a depressive mood disorder  Depression can be situational ie triggered by an event or related to genetics undiagnosed health issues stress trauma or other potential risk factors  If you have a family history of depression you are more susceptible to have depression  It would be wise for you to discuss this with a mental health provider and if necessary get treatment through counseling and medical interventions
"brighter, beautiful, amazing, high off nostalgia, sadder, memories, close friend, gone forever, move past, live in the present",Do some selfreflecting as to what areas of your life youd currently like to developThe good news is you know how happiness feelsThat you were able to create situations and dynamics which produced happiness in your life is good motivation to believe happiness is possible and to try new ways to create this in your life
"grief, guilty conscience, verbally abusive behavior, health issues, taking care, left, alive, help dealing",I see such a sharp contrast between your question and your first sentence Do you see it I feel guilty about my fathers death and I spent my WHOLE LIFE taking care of my dad Wow After everyone else had left him to his misery you hung in there He is so lucky to have had you there You didnt have to do that I have a hunch that your dad blamed you for a lot of things Abusive people do that a lot they make you believe things are your fault when theyre not You did the opposite of what you fear you did You didnt contribute to your dads death your selfless care gave him a longer lifebetter health In the end no ones love and care could save him No one could fault you for deciding you had had enough at some point I would never expect anyone to keep putting themselves in a hurting place over and over again But this is what you did You did it for him and you did it so you wouldnt feel guilty But you feel guilty anyway rightso putting yourself in that position was only worth it if you allow your loving acts to melt away the guilt Can you tell yourself Its okay that I had to take care of myself too I gave up a lot for my dad I have nothing to feel guilty aboutPutting yourself last for your dad was a loving thing to do And my hope is that you can also find different ways to help yourself feel good enough in this world and a balance between caring for others and caring for yourself
"emotional, past trauma, love, forgiveness, cheating, attention, leaving, coming back, normal",Im sorry that you lost your first born child  Death of a child always leaves a permanent reminder to the parents of a very painful time in their livesThe good news is your awareness that you and your wife are not connected in a satisfying wayThere are many possible areas to examine in your relationship as partners and as parentsIf what you write here are your observations and theories about your wifes outlook and conclusions then the first step is to directly have conversations together on the topics you write hereWhat needs clarifying is what her reasons are for wanting to leave the marriageOften a crisis such as a childs death motivates someone to look deeply into other intimate relationships  Keep in mind that looking deeply doesnt necessarily mean leaving the marriageAlso be aware of your own frustrations and marital discontent  Be ready to talk about your feelings and uncertaintiesThere is no such thing as one happy partner in a marriage and one unhappy partner   Each person is part of a system and can only be as satisfied as their partnerThe conversations that open relationship hurts and disappointments hold a lot of emotion  They are difficult to keep on trackBest recommendation is to find a couples therapist who will be neutral to each of you as individuals and help both of you examine the true health of the relationship
"loved him, passed away, anniversary, apply for apartment, not handling well, moved to new town, started new life, nothing helps",I am so sorry to hear of your boyfriends passing Grief is something that can take a long time to recover from Have you considered speaking with a grief counselor Being able to speak with someone that specializes in grief would be very beneficial Do not get down on yourself for not recovering quickly This is one of the hardest aspects to deal with in life but eventually you will be able to move forward In the mean time immerse yourself with positivity ie Good friends hobbies exercise and try to schedule a time with a counselor Perhaps there will be a support group you could also join Oftentimes it is comforting to meet others who share the same experience as youGood luck to you I hope you will find peace and comfort soon
"grieving, mothers death, cry every day, need help, still cry, stop crying, 3 years",I am sorry that you lost your mother That is a really hard thing for someone to go throughThere is really no set time for grief to be over but I agree that if it has been three years and you are still crying every day then this is past the time for normal grief I do not know how old you are and if you are in school or have a job but I would imagine that if by now you literally were doing nothing but crying every day all day someone would have noticed and would have gotten you some help For one thing bills have to be paidThere are typically five stages of grief and they can come in any order You can go back to another stage that you previously experienced Denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance are the stages At first people are usually in denial over the fact that they lose someone or are losing someone This may mean that you deny they are ill or deny that they have actually diedThen comes bargaining in which you may beg God that if you can only have this person back then you will do whatever Depression is when the reality has settled in and when we cry and really feel the loss It sounds like you are stuck in this phaseFinally acceptance is when we accept that it has happened and we pick up the pieces of our life and move onWhen we lose someone we never forget them We may always have certain days that are tough such as holidays or any special remembrance of your loved one But we do get to the place where we accept that death is part of life and that it is inevitable and that life goes onA therapist can help you explore the reasons for your extended grief and can help you with coping skills to better deal with it One suggestion I have is not to try to run from the sad feelings dont try to not feel them Embrace the feelings Let the feelings wash over you and accept them Trying not to feel something is not going to help Sadness is a part of life and needs to be felt just like happiness does Unpleasant feelings are not to be avoidedI am sincerely sorry that you lost your mother and that you have had such a hard time of it for three years now You deserve to be happy and to live a full life I am sure your mother would not want you being sad for so long I wish you all the best as you continue to try to heal from this loss and deal with your grief
"anger, guilt, over drinking, cheating, influence of alcohol, problem",Hello I commend you for your courage in taking a look at the role alcohol has in your life It sounds like youre concerned about what happens when you drink too much and I suspect you already know the answer to your question about whether you have a problem or not I imagine you would like to stop feeling guilty and would like to avoid cheating on your boyfriend or other negative consequences and maybe have a fear of being or becoming an addict or alcoholic You might have a problem but that does not necessarily mean that you are an addict I dont have information to know if addiction or dependence or other words would best describe where you are with drinking but it sounds like its begun to have some negatives so forgive me using words like addict dependence and so on I mean it more as a road map than a diagnosis The feedback Im writing here is very general and doesnt address physical dependence and many other factors that might apply to your situation  One of the ways to think about substance misuse is to think of addiction as a disease of avoidance Let me repeat that it is a disease of avoidance Your ultimate task in living a balanced life is to figure out what youre avoiding and develop other ways to manage those feelings experiences and so on And of course along the way you may want to look at triggers situations biological vulnerability social pressures coping skills relapse prevention planning and so on Depending on where you are in your drinking you might very well benefit from expertise and support Remember also that alcohol depresses our central nervous system and disinhibits us That means that alcohol is often a substance of choice to relax destress calm down etc Also it allows feelings thoughts and behaviors that we usually inhibit to be expressed If you were unfaithful and often angry thats your first signpost For angry drinkers it is often true that you dont drink and then get angry you drink in order to express anger I recommend you find someone you can speak frankly with who is knowledgeable about addiction Wishing you the best health and wellness
"send him somewhere, help him, Baker Act",More information would be needed for me to accurately answer this question such as your age whether you live with your dad or not and what other family members live in the household Something like this alcoholism is a whole family disease In other words family members often unknowingly contribute to the alcoholism and enable the alcoholic to continue the destructive behaviorFirst of all you cant make your dad do anything and constantly nagging him or begging him to stop is just going to make him defensive and make this worse Nobody can change another person What you can do is change how you react to him and the things that you and other family members do for him Research codependency Theres a great book called Codependent No More There are a lot of articles on the internet that you can read In short you have to stop enabling him Like I said you cannot control him but you can control yourself This means do not buy his alcohol Do not make it easy for him to get Dont loan him the car keys or pay any household bills for him Dont call in sick to work for him or make excuses for him in any way Do not bail him out of jail when he gets arrested He needs to be responsible for himself This may mean losing his job or losing his drivers license This may mean that he loses his family if he doesnt stop What you and your family can do is set boundaries about what you will put up with It is his choice to drink but it is your choice to put up with the behaviors of his drinking A lot of people go into rehab because their spouse said if they dont then they are getting a divorceIf you are an adult and you dont live with your dad then the best thing you can do for him is STOP doing things for him If you are a child who lives at home with him then this could be a case for child protective services In my state this is called DHS A report is made to this organization for child abuse or neglect Substance abuse in the home qualifies Of course alcohol is legal and when consumed in moderation there is no problems The problem will be the result of his alcohol consumption Does he drive with children in the car while intoxicated Is he left to care for minors while in an intoxicated state Are there any domestic violence issues due to his drinking This could be a reason for the authorities to step in You can look for a local meeting for family members of alcoholics They are similar to the AA meetings that an alcoholic should go to but are for the family members They can help you
"planning to have baby, quit smoking, hard, mental need, thinking about smoking, get rid of this addiction",Hi Good for you in planning ahead to do whats healthiest for your baby and yourself Thats a great first step Its also good that you are able to identify that its not always a physical need thats driving the addictionFor the next steps I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur The psychological or mental cravings are usually based out of habit such as having a cigarette after a meal And if youre consciously trying to quit youll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel etc etc Well if Im on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer eventually Ill give in and eat itYoure going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette Thats normal and for the most part out of your control But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought Thats what you would have to work on changing When you have that initial thought acknowledge it Ok I kind of want a cigarette now but then change the thoughts that typically follow Distract yourself think about something else do something else whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigaretteIve suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what theyre going to do when the time comes Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it Eventually it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have itBest of luck and you have a really great motivator to quit  your baby
"boyfriend broke up, needed space, deleted me, opiate addiction, sober, split, lies, using again, addiction, affect the mind",Studies have proven that addiction affects the brain there are many coping skills that addicts use to enable their addiction as well  I would recommend that you speak with someone abut your relationship and your concerns  Not only so you can have more clarity in the situation but we often tend to gravitate around or toward the same types of individuals  Being more aware of your relationship will help you in the future when reengaging in personal relationships
"abusing prescription medicine, anxiety medications, friend, pills, found, situation",Your friend needs to admit they have a problem  If not no matter how many pills you take they will find a way to get more  It is also a federal offense to take someone elses medication so if you did take it she could have you arrested  In other instances it can be more dangerous to take medication away than slowly tapering off of them  Like anything we put into our system our tolerance builds up and can effect us in different ways  I would listen to her and discuss why she feels that she needs to be on the medications rather than playing bad cop in this situation  Encourage her to get help and let her know you re there for her
"stepmom, illegally buying drugs, hiding, dad",I would suggest having a conversation with your dad and then having a conversation as a family with your stepmom  Usually there are other signs of use that can often be missed  Be aware of behavior changes and mood swings  Be supportive and ready to listen often times individuals suffering from addiction will deny use until they are ready for help
"heroin addict, sick in the head, manipulated, toetotoe, hitting, terrible, picking his girlfriend, single, living here, kicking them out, nothing is working, try and help",I think the best thing for you is to speak with someone on how you can best cope with the situation  It can be challenging living in a household with someone who is currently addicted  It is also important that you realize that you can only work on yourself  Other individuals need to take the same accountability  Enabling often happens in households with addiction It can be a challenging environment to live in
"paranoid schizophrenia, medication, methamphetamine, alcohol, sleeping naked, 12 degree weather, adopted, passed away, mother, financial responsibility, mental health facility",Im sorry to hear that your brother has been having such a rough time Hes lucky to have you on his side although he may not always see it that wayAs far as whether you can sign him in that depends on a lot of different thingsI would suggest that you Google the state and county that you live in as well as some phrase similar to crisis hotline They can tell you how it works in that county My guess is that you could sign him in as long as he met the criteria for admission at that moment but I cant  be entirely sure You could also ask the person on the phone about financial responsibility I have not heard of that being a problem but I guess it would depend on insuranceIf you have trouble finding a local  hotline consider calling the national crisis number 8002738255 and ask them to help you find someone local
"bipolar II disorder, addicted to alcohol, addicted to weed, hopeless, drinking, harming myself, harming others",What an important question Im hearing your hopelessness and fear about the damage of your substance use and it sounds like you have reason for concern While there can be negative stigma about using substances for the most part substance use is an attempt to cope with emotional distress in the absence of sufficient coping strategies We all look for comfort when we are in pain and this may be the way that you are getting comfort  even though it is also hurting you In order to stop using alcohol and weed you will need a lot of support and you will need to learn other ways of getting comfort when you are in pain or struggling with bipolar related symptoms There is nothing to be ashamed of and we all need help when we are struggling I would encourage you to reach out for support in any way that you can Have you talked with your health care providers about your concerns or friends or family members Here are some links of resources in Whistler that may be helpfulhttpwwwvchcalocationsandservicesfindhealthservicesprogramid11035httpredbookonlinebc211caservice95090549509054whistlermentalhealthandaddictionshttpmywcssorgprogramscounsellingassistancehttpredbookonlinebc211caorganization9489472alcoholicsanonymousaasquamishwhistler
"shock, morning sickness, smoking marijuana, pregnant, lost my mom, advice",Have you reached your own conclusions and reasons for these regarding the topic   When you feel confident in your own reasons for your conclusions then obviously ask your daughter in law for some time together and tell her what you think and your reasons for opinionsPlan for this meeting according to the type of relationship you have with your daughter in lawSince your son will also be affected by the prenatal conditions of his child he may also be interested in being part of this conversationAlso during your discussion find out the exact ways the morning sickness affects your daughter in lawIt is possible that scheduling adjustments in routines can be made so your daughter has more time to rest or fewer responsibilities for a while until she feels betterMaybe you and other family members can lighten her daily routines so she has more time for herself to manage her morning sickness in a less risky waySending Good luck
"Alzheimers, nasty, mean, frustrated, angry, guilty, cope",It is challenging to see ones parents age and to cope with the new demands  Your mom means a lot to you and that is why you get easily frustrated  Im guessing that it is not that she is making you do work or that her expectations are nonimportant to you because if that were the case you would not feel any guilt  Accepting the new stage will help you cope with the changes  Take a deep breath every time you feel frustrated and think of the good times you shared with your mom before her getting Alzheimers  Remember that your mom as she was is no longer and that she has reverted to a more delicate phase  Also schedule time for yourself and do things that help you relax  Caretaking of an elderly parent can take a toll on you and it is essential to incorporate selfcare  Finally look for an Alzheimers support group in your area that will help you connect with other people going through the same thing  You are a good daughter and your mom is lucky to have you in her lifeSincerely MirellaImage and Likeness Counseling
"Alzheimers, lost intellectual abilities, disappointment, frustration, ignore opinions, wishes",Good observation on your part to distinguish that your feelings in relation to your mom are not necessarily connected to the way she handles her part of the relation toward youHas your mom usually ignored your opinions and wishes in relating to youIf prior to the onset of Alzheimers she never examined her way of relating to you and if both of you have never had an open conversation about your sense of feeling hurt by her attitudes and manner with you then the relationship between you and your mom will change in ways other than rational dialogueShe may continue ignoring or overlooking your wishes because shes been stuck in this attitude for most of your lifeThe good news for you about this is realizing that who you are and your way of relating to your mom has very little to do with the way she relates to youThis is a more profound disappointment because it shows that her disconnect from you has been for longer than when the Alzheimers beganYou can however feel a little more free knowing that youre not deserving of being ignored
"mother running my life, almost 30 years old, move out, live my own life, relationship, making my own decisions, worry, talk to someone",If the only way the relationship you have with your mother feels okay is when she is the only one who makes decisions concerning your life then this only seems okIn fact it is not okay for one person to be the authority for another person unless the one for whom this is being done does not have their own ability to think for themselvesSeparating your own wishes and way of handling life matters from your mothers point of view may be difficultFirst realize you need to get familiar with feeling at ease with the idea of deciding matters for yourselfYoull need practice until you feel comfortableUnless if youve been thinking through decisions youd like to make and the idea of your mothers anger is the only point which stopped you then you may almost instantly start living in a liberated way of running your own lifeBasically it is right and fair for you to have the chance to live your life the way you feel is best   Be prepared that your mother may disagree with you and that her disagreement is not a reason itself to not do what you believe is in your best interest
"lost my mom to cancer, own cancer diagnosis, friend was there for me, dad told me, really likes my friend, wants to marry her, kids hate the idea",Hi LincolnIt can be very difficult for children who have lost a parent to then see their other parent moving forward with anyone so I understand how this change is even more upsetting to you Andyour father and your friend have clearly established a friendship and fallen in love Did you see this coming I hope they didnt hide it from you If they did maybe this is the issue It would be a legitimate oneBut in the end your father and your friend are adults who are free to fall in love with whomever they wish and hopefully they can count on the support of people who trust and love them Could there be blessings here you havent seen yet It seems you love this person who is like a sister could it be a good thing that her place in your life is more permanentAsk yourself these questions What is the worst part of this What do I fear losing What do I fear at all What is the evidence that this will happen The answers might surprise you Your children will follow your lead If you are supportive of their grandfather they will follow suit Hopefully you can grieve the change know that your mother would likely want both of them to be happy and embrace the blessings that come with having this woman close to you in a new way I wish you the best
"mother takes care, niece abandoned, calls me complaining, dont want to hear, anymore",It is understandable that its very hard for you to hear daily complaints from your mother regarding the caregiving of your niece You cannot change your mothers feelings and responsibilities which could create feelings of frustration and helplessness It must be equally hard for your mother to assume full responsibility for your niece at a time where your sister cannot take care of her This type of responsibility usually produces an enormous amount of stress and pressure because your mother and niece would both need to adapt to this new relationship living situation and the feeling of being abandoned Not knowing the history of your relationship with your mother and how you respond to each other in times of need it may be difficult to fight the right recommendation on how to deal with this situation Nonetheless it is not easy to have to face daily complaints and you may have to set a healthy balance between empathy and boundary setting with your mother and some personal boundaries for yourself It is likely that your mothers complaints may be her desperate cry for help because she does not know how to cope with stress or how to ask for the right kind of support In this case you could calmly and respectfully tell her the next time you hear her complain This must be very difficult for you because I hear the stress in your voice almost everyday Its very hard for me to hear you feeling so overwhelmed I feel helpless in this situation and would like to suggest that it might be helpful for you to seek some professional help and support to deal with such a big matter of importance When empathy and understanding is communicated recipients are usually more open because they hear and feel the caring behind it and are more likely to seek additional helpAfter sharing this message of empathy and encouragement to seek help the next step is to protect yourself by explaining to your mother where your limits are so that she understands what she can expect from you This means that you can decide the kind of support or help you are willing to give your mother andor niece that is within your ability to provide without feeling overwhelmed This could involve inviting them to dinner occasionally taking them out to see a movie or inviting your niece over to give your mother respite You could then say to her if she complains again I cannot change the way you feel in this situation and I encourage you to seek professional advice about that but what I could do is explain what you could do to helpwwwPsychologyResourceca
"yelled at, told, emotions, situation",Hello and thank you for your question I am very sorry that this was your experience with your family I truly wish I could give you some things to say to them that would change their reaction but unfortunately I cant do that Their acceptance of you is a journey just like coming out is a journey for you Sometimes families initially respond this way but after time they become more accepting and even supportive Unfortunately there is no way to know for sure if that will happen So here are a few things I would suggestSurround yourself with people and things that remind you that you really are okay as you are That wont take the place of your familys acceptance and I wont even pretend that it would but it may help during those days when it hurts the most And that is really important Patience is not something that many of us are really good at but this type of situation sometimes forces you to have some When families first learn something like this they may go through a period of shock And then sometimes even grieving They may even be worried if they are of a particular religion where being bisexual is forbidden These things can take time for them to reconcile so it may just take some patience If it is safe for you try to talk to them but if it becomes painful or hurtful then you have the right to walk away I do recommend setting up some personal boundaries for yourself and perhaps learn some assertiveness skills if you feel you struggle with them The reason I feel that this is important is that people sometimes take a lot of abuse from family members and friends in times like youre describing They may want to be accepted so much that they put themselves in hurtful positions over and over again hoping that their families will come around They may or they may not And if they dont you deserve to live a life free of abuse and to feel confident and assured of who you are To be surrounded by folks who remind you of that If you start seeing this pattern and you are struggling chatting with counselor may be a great idea I am bias probably but I think chatting with a counselor is ALWAYS a good idea  Hope this helps Be well Be you Robin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC
"problems with my mom, controlling, disregarding, explaining calmly, angry, not listening",The part of your life which is in your control is the way you handle what your mom does and the way she talks to youIt is possible the two of you have very different opinions on a great number of mattersEach person including you has the right to decide whether and how to respond to someoneStick up for your own right to make decisionsIf she doesnt accept your independent viewpoints then this doesnt give away your right to have these viewsSince she makes herself clear as to her unwillingness to listen to you then consider this as an easy way to avoid directly speaking with her about whats on your mindIf she ever shows an interest in your opinions and you feel like discussing these with her then feel free to make this choice
"love, physically together, transgender, family doesn't accept, hide, hurts",Many people do not accept the reality of gender beyond male and femaleObviously if your family doesnt accept your questioning status then this feels painfulAll you really can do is continue your selfexamination and know youre in a nonsupportive family of doing soTo know the truth about your surroundings is much better than to not know and also much better than pretending you are not in your current phase of gender expression questioning
"Aspergers, hypersexual, flirty, boundaries, marriage, relationship, honesty, losing",If you and your brother are open w each other and respect each others opinions then there is little risk your relationship with him will endIf there already is strong animosity mistrust dislike between both of you then there is more chance he will not seriously consider your adviceFor your own peace of mind say whatever you feel must be said to himThe person youll need to live with is yourself so do what you believe is needed for you to feel good about saying whats necessaryEven if he never follows through with your advice then youll still know you tried your best to advise
"teenager, importance of schooling, best effort, family, zero effort, frustration, seeking advice",Your familys opinion is quite demoralizingUnless you are lying to yourself or to them then your best effort deserves appreciation and support from familyThe family members may have reasons besides the actual outcome of your school work to be so blind to your investment of effortMaybe they target onto you their unhappiness in some other area of their lives  It is often easier to create false narratives if a person wants to avoid looking at themselvesPossibly too the family people may have a twisted logic to their words as though ignoring your effort is a way to force you to do moreIf you feel the family people will listen to the way their words affect you then definitely tell themIf not then you are learning an early lesson on how not everyone is necessarily supportive of others and how disappointing this feels
"constantly tells me what I am doing wrong, want her to be proud of me, no matter what I do, not have one nice word to say, always hateful towards me",Im sad and heartbroken on your behalfIm very sorry your mom has such negative views on youPlease know that there must be some reason in her personal history or relationship life which drives her to criticize you so stronglyThe natural dynamic is for a mother to love and nurture her childUnless at some earlier point in your relationship with her you caused some massive harm to her which would justify her indirect dislike for you then the best way for you is to find supportive and loving other people who will to some degree make up for the harshness you hear from herAlso read online about others who have similar situations because there may be good guidance on keeping yourself emotionally safe from how she treats you
"teenager, family therapy, individual therapy, parents refuse, tired, get out",This sounds like a really tough situation  As a teenager you may be able to get counseling on your own without needing your parents consent under some circumstances  If your parents are refusing to consider counseling you might want to try talking to your doctor or another trusted adult about finding some counseling resources  even without your parents help
"worth nothing, stupid, lazy, fat",There is nothing wrong with going to summer school
"arguing, every night, same thing, tells me, visit my mother, out of state, be gone, get back, do not get along",A relationship gets weaker not stronger by threatening control of the other personStart by telling your boyfriend to keep his remarks about you and the interests he is in which you two disagree limited to these areasYour relationship with your mother is between you and herRegardless of how much he doesnt like her to not respect your mother daughter relationship is unreasonable and disrespectful toward youThreatening to take action against you by withdrawing himself from your relationship is almost guaranteed to harm the good feelings between the two of youDoes you boyfriend dislike your mother for any reason having to do with her being a danger to youAsk his reason since if he does this from concern for your emotional or physical safety then this is good sentiment which is handled incorrectly by a threat to youWhat you should do is ask your boyfriend to not threaten you and to calmly talk about the topics you bring up here
"emotions, dislike, indifference, frustration, relationships, family, siblings, care, friends",Not liking someone is not cruel  even if it is a family member There is nothing wrong with you for not liking your sister Some people are fortunate to have siblings that they get along with really well other dont We all have different personalities and we are not going to like everyone  even if they are related In fact sometimes being related makes it harder because you know all of each others flaws and imperfections With that being said  it may be worth it to make an effort to talk about the things that get in the way of having the kind of relationship that you might ideally want with your sister Sometimes it is hard to like someone if we have a lot of old frustration and resentment and being able to talk about it in a constructive and kind way can lead to more understanding and respect and sometimes actually liking each other
"tense disagreements, minor differences, overbearing, lazy, intensified, talked back, little disagreement, major disagreements",One choice is for you and your wife to decide together what are reasonable ways and expectations to have of your motherFrom what you write it sounds like your wife and you have differences as to what is the proper and right way to talk with your motherOnce the both of you agree on overall philosophy and some specific details for examples then ask your mother to make time for all three of you to discuss together the expectations and standards you and your wife would like to see happenThis is only the first step since it is possible and likely that at least on a few points your mother will disagree and have different viewsThese need to be discussed and integrated into an overall plan which all three of you are happy to live with
"fighting, bad choices, hospitalized, worried, barely eating, barely sleeping, forget about him, walk away",Forgetting ones emotions is impossibleSince you are in a relationship with this guy your emotions keep your feelings active toward himDoes he respect your upset with his lifestyle choicesAre the two of you having conversations about your opinions on himYoure as entitled to dislike what he does as he is to like what he doesSince youre together in a relationship respect for the others values and how best to live life mattersHe may be as unhappy about your dislike for his lifestyle as you are with hisTry to know whether hes willing to change to accommodate youStudy whether youre willing to change to accept his waysSee whether the two sides are close enough to be different from one another and still be happy togetherThen if the answer is no you can consider to separate from him and your emotions gradually will recuperate from leaving the relationship
"mother passed away, treated like a stranger, concerned, father in nursing home, on my own, handle it, need help, family support",Understandably youd like support from those who know and love youFrom what you write your family members do not offer you your very reasonable expectationStart by telling particular family members with whom you feel youd have the most likely chance of success in their meeting your expectation by loving youThis way you are able to tell yourself youve tried what is reasonable to tryDont give up on expecting loving support for yourselfIf your family members are unwilling to give you this then start to give yourself loving attention and careGradually you will bring yourself in contact with new others who will love youLoving yourself makes you attractive so others will find your willingness to be loved
"get along, conversation, World War 3, treats me, no right to an opinion, never really lets me speak, real mother cares, tries to help, adoptive mother, wont listen",Going to see a experience counselor would be my advice  You will have a neutral person that can listen to both sides and help you all find a common ground of understanding  If she doesnt agree to counseling really the only person you can change is you  I would suggest that you approach her with love and let her know what you appreciate about her let her know the great things she have done that could not be replaced or forgotten however you want your relationship to get better than it has been lately  Hopefully this will open the door of communication where you can explain your thoughts and feeling but in a loving way
"boyfriends parents, unannounced visits, long periods of time, lets himself in, daily basis, takes our dogs, picks up our mail, NO boundaries, opinionated, rude, pushy, unsolicited advice, child rearing, respect our privacy, barges in, no warning, key, address this",Youre expecting reasonable behaviors from your boyfriends fatherSince the father is his your boyfriend is the person in position to speak directly with his dad about the expectations you and he have of the fatherIf your boyfriend has a good relationship w his dad which is not what this sounds like then greatIf your boyfriend has a stressed and tense relationship w his dad then somehow he needs to develop or be coached and encouraged by the people in his life who truly care about and know him a way to state the very reasonable standards you describe hereIf all else fails then a new living space is always another possibility
"dating, serious, wants to cut it off, giving him a hard time, related to my ex",Does your boyfriend agree with the other peoples opinions or is the problem that he feels that doing what they want will be an easy way to stop hearing them say what he doesnt like hearingTalk through whether he actually believes what the others are telling him or figures that complying will make them stop bothering himOnce the two of you understand what if any the differences are in the opinions you each have on the double relationship status youll be more clear whether the differences can be aligned somehow
"dad doesn't like, yells at me, extreme, over dramatic, depressed, asking me why, emotional abuse",Maybe this is emotional abuseIt certainly is irritating and annoying to be yelled at for being yourselfMaybe at a time when hes not yelling you can bring up the topic of your own willingness if this is true to discuss questions he has about your genderTheres no guarantee he wont start yelling midway through a dialogue like this  Only then you will be on firm ground to excuse yourself from the conversation since you already explained that youre willing to talk with him and not to be yelled at by him
"pain resurfaced, angry, handle",Emotional pain is different from physical pain that way isnt it Even many years later an old wound can be ripped open again by a small triggerYou were betrayed by two people close to you Thats a complex injury I dont know whether youre still in the marriage or not or whether your sister is still in your life Perhaps not as your contact with her seems to be through watching her facebook activity Im curious about why youre just now seeing her facebook posts again Are you feeling more open lately to seeing how shes doing in her life I guess if you were open to having your sister even in the periphery of your life again you will have to figure out how to handle those triggers If you cant maybe consider unfollowing her or detaching from facebook for a while So your sister is happy or she at least appears happy Your mind might go to some unhelpful places like She doesnt regret the affair you dont know that She doesnt deserve happiness that would be a harsh judgement or She doesnt care that Im hurt again theres no evidence of that Where does your mind go Its important to identify your worst thoughts in connection to her When you have those worst thoughts identified ask yourself What evidence supports that thought as truth Its likely that either theres no evidence or that the truth is so far from you that you cant know what shes feeling or thinking which makes having those thoughts pretty futileA therapist can help you determine what emotions are being triggered here It doesnt help you and your happiness to carry around resentment ill wishes or the need for revenge Forgiveness is not about saying that something was okay Its about saying It happened I accept that I cant change it and I dont want to carry the emotional burden around all the time Forgiveness is putting it down She trust me this is trueshe carries her own burden of shame for what she did For you to spend time feeling angry doesnt affect her burden It only adds to yours Can you find the tender emotion under your anger Youre hurt Validate that hurt Honour that hurt Take care of that hurt You can stay away from people who disregard your needs and you have the power to forgive those who make mistakes out of their simple humanity if you want them in your life If you continue to struggle please seek the help of a professional who can assist you in navigating these waters
"trust issues, reading between the lines, difficult time, making connection, deception, control emotions, abusive, intimidate, false claims, immigration application",Im sorry to hear about being taken advantage of by your former wifeOn the positive side think of how much you learned by going through this very painful timeMaybe you are naturally very generous and caring to the point of expecting very little from the other person for exampleConsider yourself in a favorable position to not feel like going out right now and meeting a new person   Your spirit is guiding you to stay put and recuperate from this ordeal review for any signs you may have been more trusting than merited by the persons behaviorTheres a natural flow to what were able to handle and when we have renewed capacity for new adventuresTheres no reason to assume that youll never trust another woman again  The first step is rebuilding trust in yourself to step into a new relationship   There is no designated time line  Youll simply feel more ready than you feel nowVery unlikely that youd ever place yourself in a similar situation to the one youre currently recovering fromGood luck
"different, never felt female, identified as male, don't know how to tell my dad",I admire your courageIf you are concerned about telling your dad regarding your gender identity I would suggest a couple of things There are a lot of groups or other supports for people who are working through some of the same changes that you may be going through now I dont mean to convey that everyone thinks feels or acts the same by any means but rather that it may be helpful to talk to others who have had some similar experiencesI was trying to include some links for you but that particular button isnt functioning window If you search for transgender support on Google youll find GLAAD and PFLAG both of which are national organizations This does not mean that you have to identify as transgender but researching that term may help you to find both national and local resourcesAs far as telling your dad if that is particularly concerning for you I suggest either talking through the details with a local therapist or considering if you have a trusted friend or family member one who will respect your privacy with regard to who you would like to know about what you are experiencing at this time so that you can talk with some people to have support This may help with two things allowing you to find some support for yourself as you work through the changes that you are going through now and also possibly talking with someone who knows your dad and may be able to talk with you regarding how or when to tell himOne thing that I tell anyone who wants to discuss something that is very important to them is to ask the person they want to talk to whether this is a good time for an important conversation That way you have greater chances of having the persons attention andor not needing to end the conversation quickly Also please remember that you know yourself best as each of us does
"siblings, mom loves, yelling, crying, room",Have you ever tried talking with her about this when shes not angry While I hear you saying that it feels like she doesnt love you there could be a lot of other pieces to this Have you ever told her about how much she means to you when shes not angry
"mess around, playfully hits, comments on outfits, scans head to toe, teenager female, normal",Its hard to tell from the way you described it Do you think he would be open to an honest discussion It could be that his comments about your outfit are designed to make you feel good or to help them show how much he cares about you as his stepdaughter As far as scanning you from head to toe I can think of reasons that parents might do that I also think that talking about it is probably very important so you really know what his intentions are That way it removes the guesswork and you have the opportunity to know what he is thinking and feeling and he can also know what your reactions are
"family and friends in an altercation, steps in, call to fight, tough time trusting, early 20s",You could be protective because of things that happened in your past or in the past of the people that you are protecting A lot of us have natural instincts that we do not want other people to be in pain For other people conflict is just hard to watch andor listen toAs for having a tough time trusting them that could also relate to past events between you and these other people or it could relate to the conflict that you mentioned It can be difficult to trust someone deeply when you dont know when the next big fight or argument is going to startThe next time you step in for someone consider asking yourself what is making you do that What are you feeling in the moment
"chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, caregiver, complain, hit me, call me names, say things happened that didnt, explodes, hate her, irritates me, live on my own",It sounds like you are hating some of the things that your mom does rather than hating herSomething you may be able to do is call the area agency on aging for the county where you live and ask for information about having other people help to care for your mom I dont know how old your mom is but if she is younger they would probably have resources to other ways that you could have help If you are both open to the possibility of someone else helping out this may help with some of the difficulties between you if you are not spending quite as much time together Do you think your mom is able to actually recognize how what she does and says affects youFrom whom do you have support during all of this
"divorced, finish out the school year, deciding, cant choose, love both places",I dont know how old you are but depending on that you may be able to talk with them about spending some time in both places Even parents who live in different states can do that sometimes Its not as frequent as spending one week at one house and the next week and the other but I know that it happensIf you can talk with both of your parents about how you would like to live in both places maybe you can all work out some kind of agreement
"bad drugs, not allowed, affected me tremendously, anger, stress",It seems like you are going trough stages of grief since the inability to see your father causes you similar feelings as if you had lost him  Perhaps you could send him letters expressing your feelings and hopes  But do understand that if he is under the influence of drugs he might not be able to empathize with your feelings or react in the way that he would have done so in the past  As the issue evolves find a therapist or counselor to help you work on letting go of that anger and stress which may affect you negatively  Find forgiveness so you can have a relationship with him in the future  Qué puedo hacer con mi padre usuario de drogasMi papa está usando drogas muy malas y no estoy autorizada a verlo por lo que me puede hacer a mí y a mis hermanos  Esto afecta mi vida tremendamente  Me causa coraje  estrésParece que estas pasando por estados de luto ya que el no poder ver a tu padre causa sentimientos similares a cuando hay una perdida  Tal vez puedes escribirle cartas expresando tus sentimientos y esperanzas  Pero comprende que si el está bajo la influencia de drogas puede que no sienta empatía o te responda como lo solía hacer  Mientras el problema se resuelve busca un consejero o terapeuta que te ayude a trabajar en resolver los sentimientos de coraje y estrés trabaja también en perdonarlo para que puedas tener una relación con él en el futuro
"boyfriend of seven years, start a life, mother is 100 codependent, extremely manipulative, suffers from type 1 diabetes, guilt, feel guilty",Focus more on your own life and less on the very heavy descriptors you wrote to describe your momAll the words you wrote represent psychological conditions which are either lifelong or take a lot of motivation and effort to changeSince the only person who can change how your mom handles her life is your mom and you are the only one who can do the same for yourself devote more energy and time to living your own life fully despite the emotions you feel regarding her
"okay relationship, loves me unconditionally, afraid to tell, personal, doesnt listen, turns it around, makes everything about her, ignores things, mental health",How can I get my mother to listen to me without her freaking outCommunication with our loved ones can be tricky but it is the key to maintaining a healthy and functional relationship with them At times it seems difficult to communicate with our family because many feelings and undercover messages are attached Especially with our mothers who often provide advice and feel responsible for us it may feel like they are making everything about themselves as they express their worries and concernsSo what to do First will be important to practice active listening skills to ensure that you are receiving and understanding the message without filtering it trough your own emotions or preconceptions of the person who speaks  Second learn and practice assertive communication skills  Those will help you to communicate a message clearly and in pieces  It also emphasizes using Istatements to express how you feel at times when emotions become affected by the interaction  Third you should practice by writing your Istatement or role playing with your counselor   The trick with communication skills is that we need to practice them as often as possible until you to master them  You can also contact a family therapist to improve those skills if it becomes challenging or contact a mediator if more issues ariseCómo puedo lograr que mi mamá me escuche sin alarmarse tantoLa comunicación con nuestros seres queridos puede ser dificultosa pero es la clave para mantener relaciones saludables y funcionales con ellos  A veces nos parece aun más difícil comunicarnos con nuestra familia porque hay muchos sentimientos y mensajes envueltos en la comunicación  Especialmente nuestras  madres  pueden hacer parecer que están convirtiendo el asunto en algo personal cuando se sienten preocupadas y responsables por nosotros y nuestras accionesY qué hacemos  Primero debemos aprender a escuchar activamente para asegurarnos de que comprendemos el mensaje y que no lo estemos filtrando a través de nuestras emociones e ideas de la otra persona Segundo aprende y practica comunicación asertiva  Esto te ayudara a comunicar un mensaje claramente y en pedazos  También te ayudar a aprender expresiones del Yo para identificar sentimientos afectados durante la interacción  Tercero es importante que practiques estas destrezas ya sea escribiendo o con tu consejero  El secreto está en practicar las técnicas de comunicación cuantas veces sea posible hasta que las uses espontáneamente  Si tienes dificultad aprendiendo estas técnicas o el conflicto con tu mama es uno muy difícil de resolver puedes contactar un consejero o mediador familiar para que te asista
"emotional, stressed, brings up the past, deal with, family first",You are very wise for a young person You have already figured out that other peoples behaviourshow they treat youits not about youits about them I love that you dont blame yourself for your moms behaviours Its not your fault Shes getting upset because she doesnt know how to manage her emotions and these emotions have to do with her past and her present stress Youre just the trigger Yes this is normal but its not necessary She can find another way to manage her stuffUnfortunately you cant help your mom a whole lot or even help her recognize this But for yourself remembering that her behaviours are her issue is the biggest piece of dealing with it You can always try some new strategies when you talk to momyou can say Ill listen you better if you dont bring up past stuff or Im worried about you mom You seem stressed or even I dont like the way you talk to me Good luck
"sexualities, being gay, bisexuality, uncomfortable, come out","Hello and thank you for your question Being bisexual can be particularly
difficult because it is often misunderstood even by people who are supposed
to be part of your own community such as lesbians and gays It happens so
often that there is actually a term for it  
bierasure This is simply something that happens when people deny that
bisexuality is a real thing or discriminate against bisexuals due to beliefs
like your parents seem to have 
The unfortunate truth is that you can never
be sure of how you parents may take this kind of information It sounds
promising that they are accepting of other sexual orientations and it may
simply be that your parents lack education about bisexuality With accurate
information they may come around but there is no way to be sure 
Some of my colleagues have already given you good information Here are some more things that you can consider
and questions you can ask yourself before making the decision to tell them
 
1      If they dont respond the way you want them to have you developed a support
system to support you through it This is very important The truth is that all
the friends in the world wont prevent pain or sadness if your parents dont
respond as you hope but they will at least be there to remind you that you ARE
okay as you are And that is critical for you to remember 
 
2      There is great information on the internet about bisexuality that you can
offer your parents if you think it would be helpful It may be important for
them to know the kind of damage that is being done to bisexual adults and young
people because of the myths surrounding bisexuality Here is an article from
GLAAD about bierasure httpwwwglaadorgbisexualbierasure
 
3      Coming out to people is obviously deeply personal and should only take
place when you are ready Sometimes people get pressured from friends media
and even people they are romantically involved with to come out before they are
ready It really is up to you If you are feeling pressure from others dont
feel bad about setting your boundaries and telling them that you will come out
on your own time Intimate partners should respect you enough to understand
this 
 
4      Something else to think about is your own comfort in being bisexual Just
because someone is LGBTQ doesnt mean that they necessarily want to be Many
people struggle with this Having
your own doubts or insecurities may also play a part in how comfortable you are
in telling your parents So perhaps do some selfexploration about your
feelings toward yourself 
 
Sometimes people take friends with them
when they decide to come out to their parents This is something you may want
to consider The important thing to remember is that you are okay Really If
your parents dont respond well that doesnt mean that they never will Some
start off upset but then work their way through it 
Best of luck to you

"love, own gender, parents against, afraid, not want me anymore",Hello and thank you for your question This is one of those times when you wish you could assure someone that everything will go perfectly but unfortunately I cant do that There is no way of knowing how parents might respond until you tell them The truth is that people have come out to their parents in many different ways Some have told their parents directly some drop hints some have had others tell their parents etc The only right way to come out is the one that you choose The one that feels right to you That is the best way Some people decide not to come out and some wait for a very long time Both of these things are okay Coming out is deeply personal and there can be real consequences to someones emotional health and safety if they tell the wrong person That is why it should only be done when you are ready When you feel that you have the emotional and personal support that you need to take the risk Sometimes people can feel pressured to come out but I encourage you to do it in your own time The truth is there is a spectrum of how peoples parents react to this kind of news On one end you may have the parents who shut a person out and are abusive and on the opposite side you may have parents that are totally okay with it and throw you a Coming Out party Most parents are going to fall somewhere in the middle It is important to remember that their feelings may change over time Many parents struggle at first but they love their kids and get better with it over time If you decide to tell them consider taking someone along to support you Plan ahead on what you want to say It can be an emotional time so do what you need to do to take care of yourself If you need to leave You dont have to stay anywhere where someone is being cruel to you I wish you well and good luckRobin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC
"bossy, treats me like a child, argues, stupid stuff",This is a common issue You grow up gradually and parents often forget to shift their habitual responses according to your newfound level of maturity and growing need for freedom and independance Im all for helping you find new ways to cope and interact with your mom Ultimately you only have control over yourself so thats the place to start You can remind yourself that Moms behaviours dont mean that she doesnt trust you or love you its just that she has habitual ways of talking to you that seem stuck in the fourteen year old range If you can see her responses as habits rather than a reflection of how she feels about you then you can keep yourself calm The more calm you are the more she will buy into it when you invite her into a different sort of relationship Take a look at the picture from her perspective She may feel overwhelmed with finances are you in college and feel burdened by the mundane tasks in life that she doesnt know how to recruit help for I bet your mom spends a lot of time picking up after you cleaning cooking doing laundryall those thankless mom tasks Take a look at how she talks to you is she nagging about chores Can you see that underneath the nagging theres a pretty overwhelmed and powerless person who needs assistance  Okay so my guess is that you both have a legitimate beef She wants help You want respect Lets talk about how you get bothI propose that you sit down with mom and negotiate out a different sort of dynamic MomI see us as stuck in how we interacted when I was fourteen Can we do this differently in a way that we both get what we want Sell it as winwin Then you write down some things that end up forming a contract The first part is stuff thats your business and your business alone things you want your mom to respect like your room your school your job your personal relationships and hygiene Moms voice has no place in these arenas unless you are storing food in your room and its a health hazard This is a Mom says nothing about list The second part is about what Mom needs from you What are her expectations about your role in the home as an adult Does she want you to contribute to rent Buy your own food Do your own laundry What items can we put in your control that would take some burden off of Mom How will these things be enforced What will happen if you dont follow through Write it all down so its really clear It has to all be mutually agreed uponThe third part of the conversation is about how she talks to you and how you talk to her You can let her know that you dont want to be told what to do or when to do it that doesnt work when youre 20 years old Listen to what she wants too Beyond the contract youve just written up anything else you want from each other is a request its optional and whether and when you do it is at your discretion My guess is that if she spoke to you with more respect youd be more willing to help out AND I think if you participated a bit more she would nag at you less Go for the winwin I wish you well as you negotiate a new relationship with Mom
"devastating, not the same, fights every day, kicked out, break down",You undoubtedly are carrying a huge weight on your shoulders Stressors come in many forms and you are engulfed in a few of the major ones as it relates to dealing with the declining health of your father family conflict as well as trying to balance a work and school schedule Stress if left unchecked has many negative health related implications First and foremost I would recommend going to see a counselor at your collegeuniversity Most colleges have counseling centers for students that usually allow for 56 free counseling sessions your tuition actually pay for these sessions so take advantage of them Secondly I would advise you to take a minute and breathe When confronted with overwhelming life issues it is common to busy ourselves in an attempt to distract ourselves from the drama but sometimes that can compound our stress When dealing with stress it is important that you engage in self care In other words find time to engage in activities that bring you a sense of peace enjoyment and fulfillment in order that you may get a momentary release from your daily hectic life Even with a normal life there is no way to escape stress it is inevitable and a part of life but how you deal with stress as well as how you take care of yourself in the midst of these whirlwind events will determine your quality of life I hope this helps
"mother cheating, dad, texting dirty things, talk, parents separate ways, stop, not fair",You as the child in the middle of your parents problems is the worse position to be in  I can only imagine your hurt pain and confusion on what to do  Honestly this is a hard question to answer without knowing your age your parents ability to handle hearing information from you and your maturity to handle what may happen in the end  One thing I would like to noteyour parents may be in the same house but if your mother is cheating they have already gone their separate ways
"avoid talking, upset, cant be honest, rude",Hi Troy I totally get this Its a dilemma you want your dad to know how hes hurting you but you dont feel safe enough to say anything to him Your reaction is understandable its his responsibility as a parent to work harder than you to create that safe place for you to be open But thats not who your dad is Your dad is your dad and waiting for him to change wont really help Nothing you do can change your dad butthere are things you can do for yourself and your relationship with him While your response of avoiding him is understandable I wonder what effect it has on your dad Its possible that hes feeling frustrated rejected and punished by your withdrawal You may think he knows that youre feeling hurt but he probably doesnt So this is the squirrel chasing its tail your dad is rude so your habit is to be silent then he maybe feels abandoned and frustrated His frustration comes out as more rudeness which makes you want to withdraw more and the cycle starts all over again You cant change his part of the cycle but you can change yoursAre you willing to take a risk Can you be honest about how youre feeling Whats the worst thing that could happen if you said to your dad You know why I avoid you I stay silent because when I talk to you say rude things So if you want me to talk I need to know you can listen I imagine it would come out differently because youre a few generations younger than me but put that into your own wordsI dont know the level of your dads rudeness If he is abusive then a better plan is to see a therapist alone or talk to someone about this I dont want to put you at any risk But if you dont worry your dad will hurt you maybe give honesty a tryMy point is that as rude as your dad may be checking out of a relationship by being silent is also rude Its powerfulyour silence Your dad cant read your mind and if you want things to be better you will need to get in that ring with himAnd if youre both open to it seeing a therapist together can be really helpful
"depression, social anxiety, therapy, hasn't worked",Congrats on your upcoming grandchildDoes your daughter want you to break news of her pregnancy to the familyTalk with your daughter first whether or not she would like you to tell other family membersAlso given the other facts you mention in your post if household and financial management are areas you feel your daughter is vulnerable then bring up these topics tooStay open minded about your daughter having views which are different from yours
"mean, best friend, conclusion, mother, cause",Hi MorristownTheres a saying that goes hurt people hurt people Its possible that your aggression towards your friends is connected to your mothers behaviours When we are treated poorly especially as children it affects how we ourselves others and the world Its also powerful modelling of aggressive behaviour The good news is that you have this lovely awareness and I think a desire to learn about yourself and grow in your ability to be respectful to people you care about I recommend you consider sitting down with a therapist and exploring these ideas and moving forward on that path you seem to want to be on Good luck
"mistakes, forgive, cant, feel, face",How someone feels when they forgive another is at peace with themselves and their understanding of what went wrong who was responsible for what in the situation and clarity on their own motivation actions emotions including pain regret resentment sadnessThese steps ideally allow a new door to open in order to develop new paths in the existing relationship or accept that this will not be possible due to either persons way of handling themselvesThe long answer would be that youre not yet through with this processI commend you on being truthful with yourself about yourselfYoure on the right track by expecting to feel resolved when youve reached resolution and not beforeFinding patience with the unpredictable amount of time needed to thoroughly examine all the details of the incidents you mention sometimes is a frustration of its ownKeep up your good work of knowing your own lifeIt is a worthwhile endeavor
"fighting, good relationship",The best way to work on a relationship is for both people to engage with the problem and start communicating with each other more effectively  One of the hardest things about this however is getting both people within the relationship to recognize that they are both responsible for the successes and failures within the relationship and remove all the allornothing blame The best style of communication is open and asking for clarification why not try asking your mother why this particular fightsituation is eliciting such an angry response  Often the simple act of expressing that we dont understand the other persons point of view can open the doors to better levels of communication The hardest part is trying to remain humble as we seek out that clarification and avoid the blaming language we are so used to using in such times
"teenager, brother, older, girlfriend, hangs out, close, sad",Hi Zionsville Its so sweet that you have a special relationship with your brother You will ALWAYS have that you know Hes doing whats natural at his agespreading his wings and looking for love You may be heading into that zone soon too but I get that its weird that hes there before you and you miss himTry to respect your brothers autonomy wish him well be friendly with his girlfriend and its also okay to say Hey bro Im still here When can we hang out
"hurt, family issues, loneliness, depression, scared, headaches, insomnia, loss of appetite",Hi FloridaI get the sense that aside from this relationship youre quite isolated in general Its sad that youre feeling excluded at Christmastime and family events While I would suggest that you dont really know what he or his family are thinking or feeling you assume theyre against you and that he doesnt care he is certainly behaving in a very distant excluding manner and its understandable that you would feel rejected and hurt How long has this part been happening Has he always acted this way or is it more recent Did something happen recently You mentioned doing stupid things to yourself and I dont know what that means If you are engaging in selfharm he may be confused about what to do and he might need some time to think and be separate but is having trouble talking about this Part of the problem of course is that you dont know whats going on for him Certainly you deserve the truth and if he doesnt want to spend time with you I would hope he would be honest Have you been open to hearing the truth from him Is there any reason for him to hesitate to tell you why hes being distant Maybe you could ask him if you are ready to hearIm glad to hear that you believe that you deserve a full loving relationship although it seems that moving forward might be difficult for you Is it possible your happiness is a bit too dependant on this man Im just guessing based on what youve said here  It seems that its possible your situation has led to some depression and I would recommend a session with a qualified therapist to help you sort this out You will need support even if the relationship is repaired Best of luck
"belittled, insecure, frustrated, shortfused, temperamental, lack of communication, condescending comments, inconsiderate, negative, oblivious, self consumed, hurt, affected, relationship",Do you have a close friend or relative whos opinion you trust Ask them for their honest feedback and if they see you like your cousin does If they dont see these qualities in you then it may be your cousins issue and shes taking it out on you You can always ask her what would be the best way to communicate plans with her so you know specifically what she is expecting Then if you meet these expectations and she still blames you and comments on how inconsiderate you are its her issue and she is not coming from a place of loveEven if you do resemble her comments the way it sounds like she approaches this problem is not out of love The fact that youre introspective enough to consider your own behavior suggests the problem is not with you
"happy, love, teenagers, broke, tears, lie",I understand that this can be difficult when you care about someone Have you had a discussion with your mom as to why she does not want you and this boy to see each other and what her concerns are It sounds as though you and your mom may be able to use some help with communicating and compromising It is understandable that you do not to feel comfortable having  to lie to your mom It  would be helpful if she could understand that you having to lie to he is getting in the way of you being able to go to her with any issue and  feel she will hopefully understand or try to understand where you are coming from  Have either one of you been in family therapy This may be something you may want to suggest to your mom to help you both understand where each one is coming from If your mood is sad and your feeling worse it is important that you reach out to an adult parent person at school whom you trust to share your feelings and help you feel understood and work through your problems
"applying to private high schools, playing basketball, love it, hated team, want to quit, unfair, planning on playing basketball, high school, threatening, run away",The situation in your family seems to place unnecessary pressure on youAre you and your parents able to talk together about their reason for their standardAre your parents willing to listen to your reasons to not play on the team you hateIf yes then maybe some type of compromise is possible for all of you to negotiateIf none of the above is possible then you may want to get specific and direct advice from a professional such as the school guidance counselor or psychologist whom youd trust and feel safe in talkingI hope you and your parents will find an answer that all of you are happy to accept
"arguing with father, stressed over work and health, demanding tone of voice, upset often, too sensitive, overreacting, hurting my feelings, never listens",Thanks for the question Regardless of whether or not you are sensitive it is okay to want better communication with those who are important to you When we feel that we are being talked down to or being ridiculed it is difficult to not take it personally It sounds like you have taken the first and necessary step in resolving this by bringing up the issue to him Is it possible that the delivery of your message is causing him to feel blamed or defensive Try communicating with him during a time when you are not upset and when it is out of context Begin your statements with I as opposed to you For example you can tell him I feel angry when you raise your voice at me instead of You always yell at me Also avoid using black and white terms such as never and always Additionally offer sugggestions as to ways that he can better communicate with you Maybe he just doesnt know how to Lastly when delivering a message I like to use the sandwich method by starting off the discussion with something postive and ending it with something postive For example you may say something to the effect ofDad I enjoy the discussions we share and really value your opinion There are times that I feel angry when you talk to me aggressively Perhaps you can try talking to me using a calmer tone when I bring up heated topics Lets try and work on this together I will try to be less sensitive and I am asking that you be more calmI hope you find this useful
"problems, drama, arguments, incident, concern, argument, frustration, hurting, party, control, schedule, threats, emotions, constant battle, children, pickup details, exboyfriend, husband, exgirlfriend, daughter, stepdaughter, decisions, party plans, birthday, crazy",Hi I appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation I agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children Children need adults around them to act maturely cooperatively and peacefully even when they dont like each other it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing Your exboyfriend seems more focused on his own needs In fact he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive controlling and manipulative bordering on parental alienation I agree this is a problemI also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy Its not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress Honour this instinct you have I will suggest a few things to you First to gather support around you professionally if you need it from family and friends and certainly from your husband If you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex that will help He can help run interference when it comes to his daughter It will help you feel supportedKnow that your exs behaviours arent happening because you did anything wrong its the way he operates and maybe this is why youre not with him You cant change him but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression Youre correct that he will always be there and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situationKeep on defining clear boundaries You might sound like a broken record Youll have to talk to my husband about that but thats okay Its okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle Its okay to not respond to texts or other communications that arent vitally important Its okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable Its okay to not engage with him more than is necessaryRegarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you I recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully Let him know what your expectations are simply and clearly and in writing our agreement states X and you are not following our agreement Your daughter doesnt have to be aware I think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflictA professional therapist can help you with all of this I hope this helps get you started towards greater peace at least within yourself
"treats me like, not in her presence, always yelling, no reason, more respect, my brothers, fight her, respect her",Attention is not equal to love and being valued It may be precisely because your brothers demand so much more your moms attention through fighting with her that she pays more attention to them It is a common situation in families where the squeaky wheel gets the grease and the siblings or family members who dont demand as much attention end up feeling invisible It sucks to feel invisible and it is important that there is attention for you and that you know how much your mom loves and values you  This sounds like an important conversation to have with your mom and if she is not able to really understand or help you address this concern you may want to suggest doing some family therapy where a skilled therapist can help you and your family work this out
"problem with extended family members, inappropriately urinating, cat litter boxes, bottles, directly on floors, corners of my house, literature supports, adults behaving, trying to understand",Hi This sounds like a very challenging and upsetting problem  good for you for reaching out My first thought is these two adults may have a sleep disorder that could be contributing to the urination in inappropriate places Since they are adults and you cant force them to seek treatment  you might be able to suggest that there could be an underlying medical issue and advise they speak with a medical provider  As far as what to do for yourself  set some firm boundaries Be clear about the expectations of your home Also include the positive and negative consequences should they decide to address or avoid this issue I hope this helps you your family members and the pets
"beautiful lady, love, heart, boys, daughter, grandchildren, tearing us apart, family, happy, mistake, leave, love, save my marriage, boys, work it out, love, family, advice, hope, heart broken",If your wife is willing seek out a qualified couples therapist Look for one trained in the Gottman Method or Emotionally Focused Therapy Your relationship is repairable but you may need some qualified support in the process
"dating, online, sex offender, plea, past, forgive, falling in love, dump, family, unforgiving, granddaughter",Thank you for your question Trust is a huge thing in relationships and when that is broken or perceived as being broken it takes a long time to repair From what you shared it sounds like your boyfriend took steps to correct the situation and has shown to be trustworthy since Unfortunately no matter how much we apologize for something we did or for something others perceive we did there will always be those with hardened hearts and will not forgive If you feel confident in your relationship then trust your inner wisdom We cannot control others but only ourselves Respect your families wishes to remain in unforgiveness while at the same time ask them to respect your wish to believe in him and be in this relationship Good luck to you
"issues with my relative, police never believe, experiences, kid, trouble reaching therapist, adult help, advice",I think it would be wise for you to call a hotline especially designed for children Its called the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline The number is 18004ACHILD 18004224453 It is completely anonymous and a trained therapist will be able to provide you with guidance confidentiality and can also help you make a report of you wantThe call is completely free and they are open 24 hours a day  7 days a week Im glad that you are taking steps to improve your situation You are a very brave and an intelligent child Please remember to call 911 if you are in immediate danger
"emotions, pets, get rid, dig hole, ground, RIP, no emotions, realization, not normal, comparing, reaction, situations, family, wrong with me",It sounds to me like you have had a lot going on and now you are afraid you are going to lose the last things you care about your pets I do not know what all is going on in your family and I cannot answer for your dads actions or his reasoning behind thisI would recommend that you focus on developing healthy coping skills We cannot change what others do but we can change how what they do affects us If you have all of your emotions and all of yourself tied up into one thing like your pets then when that thing is taken away it causes a lot of emotional distress It is really good to have a wide variety of interests such as friends hobbies games etc Develop other things that you care about and are passionate aboutAnother reason for developing healthy coping skills to deal with whatever might be going on in your life is if you dont have healthy ones you may develop some very unhealthy ones You have to cope somehow right Developing unhealthy ways of coping with life is only going to make life more difficult for youI dont know if this is what it is like for you at your house but there are two kinds of household environments that can cause dysfunction in children One is when you grow up in a very rigid stern household where all decisions are made for you and you feel like you have no control over anything The other is a household where things were chaotic and you never knew what was going to happen next and had no stability People need to have some stability in their lives and need to feel in control over some things in order to feel safe Both of these environments can lead you to develop some unhealthy ways of coping with life Please talk to a trusted adult about your feelings before it gets any worse
"secrets in my mind, don't know what to do, don't want to hurt them, keep the secret, becoming annoying, making me anxious, help me out",It sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now There are several things to consider before you make a decision You mentioned that you dont want your wife and mom to know because you dont want to hurt them  why would it hurt them  Is it necessary for them to know this information What are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them for you and for your wife and mom Once you have considered these think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation Also if your wife or mom were in your situation right now what do you think they would do themselves If your wife and mom were in this situation how would you feel Would you want to know the secrets How has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical healthOnce you have looked at the problem from all angles you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not
"argue, never agree",For how long has the arguing been occurring and does it relate to a specific incident or circumstance in your relationshipArguing due to temporary stress and feeling lost or uncertain is different than the two of you rarely agree on what foods to buy at the grocery storeIn both temporary or longer term arguing ask yourself if the points being argued are core principles of yours or matters which you can accept in service to the benefits you feel from the marriageIf your core principles are rejected youve been arguing for an extended amount of time and the value of the marriage doesnt outweigh this then seriously consider if ending the relationship is a better option than to stay in it
"healthy marriage, last",This is a fantastic question In one sentence I would say the followingRecognize that while you and your partner probably have common interests and areas of commonality you are separate people each with different wants wishes and desires  if you consider a diagram of two overlapping circles they may share perhaps a third of the circle with overlap to indicate commonality could be more or less and then there are parts of the circles that are not overlapping indicating separate interestsAs for ways that may strengthen any relationship even the great ones this is what came to mind There are certainly more specific unique answers or elements for different people as far as the details but here are some general ideasTry to have at least 15 minutes a week where you are spending time together and not problemsolvingRealize that listening to your partner does not mean that you are agreeing with them it just means that you are saying that you hear where they are coming fromLearn to hold on to your own wants wishes and desires while also recognizing those of your partnerSet boundaries for what is and isnt acceptable behavior during an argument or difficult discussionDiscuss how having important discussions can be anxietyproducing and consider having an understanding that if one of you or both of you feels overwhelmed you can take a timeout for a certain amount of time For example you may say okay Im feeling really stressed about this right now Lets discuss it in an hour And at that time go back to the discussionConsider what your partners top three or four complaints about you may be Check in with them and see how accurate you are If you see validity in their responses consider whether or not you may want to make changesDiscover what makes your partner feel loved valued appreciated or specialRelationships are always in progress and constantly changing Some anxiety around change is typical Being able to effectively discuss the anxiety and actually listen to one another without being defensive name calling fingerpointing or asking each other to change is a true giftYou may enjoy this quote Connection is the energy that is created between people when they feel seen heard and valued when they can give and receive without judgment Brene Brown
"cheating, love, truth, proof, begging, yelling, cusses, attitude",Hi Prattville Im sorry this is happening to you You need support right now and yes you need answers She is in denial and is trying to hide the truth to protect herself This is a natural behaviour You dont indicate whether she wants the marriage or is planning to leave Which way you go from here depends in part on the answer to that question If she wants the marriage you certainly have the right to say I need answers to all my questions Giving you the information she needs has to be if she wants the marriage more important than protecting herself I would support your right to advocate for all the information you need in order to feel secure or make decisions She may fear that the truth will turn you away If you want to you can reassure her that you want the marriage no matter what the truth is If the marriage is to survive it needs opennessIf on the other hand shes planning to end the marriage then you might want to resign yourself to the fact that you may never get the information you seek You are better off in that case seeking support from friends and family rather than beating on a closed door Your wife has some decisions to make Try to give her a bit of time to make them You can patiently say I know this thing is happening Talk to me so we can deal with it together I want to move forward but I need the truth Only time and a good therapist if she is willing and wants the marriage will tell which way this one will go Individually you can seek professional help as well
"listening to my husband, never listens to me, get my husband to listen to me",Thanks for your question  Communication is essential between couples and often times gets neglected in relationships  Working with your husband to help him become a better listener and consequently a better communicator is going to take some work from your part  You have to calmly be able to express to him your concern and how it affects you  Very important is that you do it in a loving and nonthreatening way  Therefore the time to have this discussion is not when you are frustrated or need to vent to someone about something important  Focus the discussion on how both of you could benefit from having more meaningful conversations where both parties are being heard and how it is important to you that he hears you just like it is crucial for him to be heard  There is a lot of useful information online about how to be a good listener or therapist in your area that can help you  Be patient and genuine and he will come around  Best of Luck Mirella
"married three months, argue, getting worse",One key factor to consider is are you able to repair after your arguments It seems from your question that repair is lacking after any disagreement or argument When couples are able to repair after an argument they have an opportunity to learn more about each others needs moving forward Im also curious if youre having the same type of arguments over and over If youre stuck in a particular pattern and can start recognizing what happens between you when this pattern happens then you can start to name it Once you name it then you can take a break to cool off and come back to each after your nervous system has had a chance to calm down about 30 minutes The key here though is to make sure you have a plan in place  when things are good between you  an agreement between you that when you both start to get escalated youll name it or have an agreed upon code word to signal you dont want to continue this cycle and then agree to cool off and come back together at a later time That way when this is enacted during an argument nobody feels abandoned during the cool off time Rather both partners know they will return at a time when they can truly hear each other and hear their needs
"emotions, symptoms, situations, dont like, certain things, pertains to me, not like that, anything to say, tell him, something about himself",It sounds like there are issues with communication between you and your husband  Your perceptions of interactions that you are having dont sound like they match up  It would probably be helpful for you both to work on communicating using I statements I feelwhen you  This is a more effective way of communicating your needs than directly criticizing the other person  If you work on communicating in new less critical ways you both may learn more about your spouses feelings and perspective
"unacceptable, struggling, forget, forgive, trust issues, relationship, children getting hurt, move forward",First of all my heart goes out to you Infidelity is an extremely challenging obstacle to overcome There are some things that you should consider First of all did he seem truly remorseful If you felt in his heart that he was truly sorry for what he had done it will give you a piece of mind that it was a  mistake Secondly was he forthcoming with this information How about with answering your questions after the truth was uncovered If you found that he was still lying or not forthcoming the sting is even more painful He should be able to answer any question you have honestly and without hesitationThirdly has he shown a positive difference after this experience At this time he should still be proving his faithfulness to the marriage you and the childrenKeep in mind that experiencing infidelity is a form of grief It is not a quick process that can easily be overcome What you are experiencing is 100 normal My best suggestion would be to see a marriage therapist Find out what drove your husband to cheat in the first place and decide if this aspect in his life has been resolved I know its important for you to keep your family together but children can sense anger and frustration this is not a healthy environment either If you decide that you can no longer remain in the relationship a therapist will also be able to help you cope with the separation along with addressing your childrens needsPlease know that you are not alone and that unfortunately many relationships have endured this very thing It may also be helpful to reach out to people who have experienced similar obstacles The web is a great resource to find groups whether online or in person to use as a support or sounding boardBest of luck to you and your family
"wear makeup, wear heels, tucks his penis away, resemble a vagina, wear a strap on, anal sex, tried this, don't like it, making comments, can't live without",Depending on your own sexual history and what you grew up expecting to be normal in the bedroom I can easily imagine that this came as quite a shock to you  It DOESNT necessarily mean however that your husband is gay bisexual transgender or even necessarily a crossdresser etc unless he has already told you so I agree with the other poster who recommended you try and ask him more questions with an open and curious attitude and see if he might be open to explaining more with you That being said what we also know from research is that frequently what turns us on isnt always what we identify as  Lots of people have fantasies or even sexual behaviors they may enjoy from time to time without considering themselves to be a part of any label or subculture For example many women are okay with having their hair pulled or bottom spanked during a particular rowdy sexual encounter but certainly dont consider themselves kinky submissive or anything else  It could be that your husband enjoys pretending fantasizing that he is something completely different in the bedroom from time to time from what most other see him as outside in the corporate world or in other roles he plays as husband father son friend etc  Many of my kink clients are drawn to their particular fetish simply because its the opposite of what their life typically entails eg a high profile CEO who is always responsible for making the decisions enjoys being at the mercy of someone else once a week Each of us has a sexual script  a blueprint if you will of what we like and dont like in the bedroom and also what we have each come to see as being normal  Its also an internal guideline for how we each define our role in sexual expression sexual orientation sexual behaviors sexual desires and how big a part our sexual identity plays in our everyday lives Gagnon  Simon 1973Youve been clued into the fact that your husbands greatly differs from yours on the surface level at the moment ALL of us are sexual beings yet none of us is exactly identical to one another in our sexual definitions and script expectations Its like our own sex fingerprint In my role as a couples counselor I often help partners become aware of their own sexual script and explore where it overlaps their partners and where it may always differ  If a couple is able to successfully navigate formulating a plan for both to feel validated and sexually satisfied the relationship thrives Most counselors would agree that a healthy script includesBoth partners taking ownership for the couples sexual experiencesBoth partners learning to communicate openly and honestly about their feelingsBoth partners learning to meet one anothers  needs desires and wishes while making sure hisher own needs are being metIf pegging your husband as its called is a hard and fast no for you that will likely need to be respected as it may be too far off your own sexual script  However if your husband is for sure absolutely adamant about needing to dress in a female fashion andor be anally penetrated you may seek professional counseling to help navigate how both of you will come to an agreement about fulfilling these desires in a way that doesnt hurt either one of you or the marriageMy warmest wishes to you both
"love, doesn't show love, talks badly, friends",What you are describing is a state of abandonment like no other a direct lack of respect The challenge here is you cannot control another person no matter how hard you try The only person that you have control of is yourself So then the question that this reality poses is What are you willing to change If you love yourself and know that you have tremendous value if you can see what you bring to a relationship and that you deserve respect and love and tenderness then you will get to a point where you will settle for nothing less than that The change that might be necessary in yourself is to change the way you see yourself the way you treat yourself and what you accept Your husband also needs to change and that is something only he can do for himself but reaching out to get help as well It would be helpful for you both to get help because there is damage on both parts You have much more power than you realize and talking with someone can help you to hone that power and make a difference in your own life Sometimes the differencechange can be walking away from a bad situation or it can simply be changing your attitude and raising the bar Sometimes our loved ones come with us on the elevation and sometimes they get left behind  You must do some deep introspection through therapy to get to the point where you can answer this question for yourself
"hospital, diagnosed with leukemia, dealing with, mad at me, things that I said",I dont know how long you have been married but this might be a time to explain to your husband what you wish he could do for you in this moment It could be that he is showing that he is getting mad at you because he is worried about you and it is just coming out wrong Maybe he would be open to an honest discussion
"different person, working, sleeping, off days, staying home, going out with friends, working 50 hours a week, taking care of two kids, emotionally starving, misses me, wants me to be his adored wife",It seems that you have been very disconnected from each other which naturally  could contribute to symptoms of saddness and even depression Obviously something has shifted which you do not understand Therefore  perhaps you should consider attending Couples therapy to help work through your concerns and feelings  It would also be beneficial to assess if in fact any depression or other underlying issue is going on Communication is so important in any relationship and the manner in which we express ourselves to our partner can either invite curiosity and emotional connection or shut down connection IMAGO dialoguing is a helpful tool for couples for communication as it teaches  validating and empathic listening to better heal disconnection
"emotions, getting over the situation, fair, expects, move on, love, laugh, play, wife, sit on the couch",Houston Its normal for this kind of thing to be a trigger so I get why you dont want to sit on it but to keep refusing keeps the affair alive Am I to assume that you cant afford a new one Ideally she buys you a new couch but it certainly would be a gesture of love for you to do it too and it will help you both move forward t will be interesting to see if theres anything else that keeps the problem alive after the couch is long gone
"feeling different, growing from the relationship, lack of connection, feeling nothing, being irrational",Lacey Im SO glad you wrote Thousands of people are having this same feeling right now Im glad youre paying attention to it When you first meet someone there are all kinds of sparkly feelings and you both do and say lots of things to cement the attachment and create deep intimacy and connection Then what happens is because we have that connection established we instinctively cut back on those loving behaviours because we dont have to work hard to earn their love anymore That sparkly feeling typically lasts a few years long enough to procreate and keep the human race going and then it wears off a bit and you end up looking at each other thinking how come I dont feel the same anymoreMostly not always and Ill get to that in a minute all that this means is youve stopped doing all those loving things you used to do Its as though you filled the car with gas youve run out of gas now and youre forgetting to put more inThe first clear solution to this feeling is to bring back more of your own loving behaviours that youve cut back on Act lovingly and you will likely regain those feelings Talk to your partner about this Its okay to say do you remember we used to do XY and Z Can we do that again Can I get more of the foot rubs you used to give me Ask for what you want instead of complaining What are your love languages What are your partners Marriages need to be fed Its that simple Many things get in the waychildren jobs but mostly complacency Get active with your loveOkay now you might read this and think thats not whats happening Thats a cue to talk to someone like a therapist about your feelings People do grow and change and sometimes relationships dont fit anymore But these are huge decisions not to be made lightly I wish you happiness
"overwhelming desire, watch, wife, sex, another man, talked, excites, disgusts, struggling, years, mid 30s, mid 40s",Try to understand your own ambivalence to having your wish fulfilledSince you and your wife are in a relationship the sex she will have with another man will affect emotions in both you and your wifeI suggest you and her prepare emotionally before you both go ahead with the sexual arrangementBy anticipating any jealousy or feeling helpless or out of control or in control since its your wish being fulfilled all the feelings you and her are able to expect youll be more prepared for the actual emotions from the episode which may also resolve your conflicted feelings about creating the eventThere are a lot of unknowns in the situation youre considering  Having your partner who will be key in satisfying your sex wish be active in understanding these unknowns is a good way of keeping your relationship strong overall
"high school, married, beautiful children, time apart, moved, dads, see the kids, counseling, given up",While it would be impossible for me to say whether your marriage can be saved it sounds like you are both willing to give it a try and to get professional support With appropriate professional support for your relationship a lot is possible Im not familiar with the resources available in Jackson but Im sure there are some good local couple therapists and there may be some agencies that specialize in couple counselling and family therapy So often the challenges that we have in relationships result from rather small habits in relating that lead to greater feelings of distress loneliness anger and resentment I commend your willingness to put effort into creating the strong loving relationship that you want for both of your sakes and of course for your children The following links provides more information regarding common behaviours that predict staying together or separating and also videos and other resources that can help you get started Wishing you and your family all the best on your journey of healing and discovery
"crazy, frustrated, pointing out, needs to change, looking up, explaining, almost pulled, afraid, get hit by a car",I empathize with your feeling crazy hearing your husband yell enough in response to you wanting to make a point to himWhen the immediate situation has calmed down  have you ever told him that this upsets you  Is it possible he simply is not aware that you feel upset by how he talks to youKeep in mind too that what you believe your husband must change may not agree with his opinion on what he needs to changeA helpful starting place for the two of you to discuss once the immediate situation has calmed down is what you each feel would have been a reasonable way of handling the situation that just happenedBy learning more about how the other person thinks and feels it will be easier to know what to expect form each otherEven if you disagree about what is best knowing that there are differences between you may make living with them easier to accept or at least not be surprised and startled by themSending good luck to both of you
"trust issues, past mistakes, ups and downs, feeling tired, feeling accused",Im sorry to hear about the trust issues in your relationship Trust as you clearly know is essential to healthy relationships Past indiscretions or dishonesty can damage this trust and make it really hard to confidence that these things will not happen again despite reassurances We tend to be very sensitive to betrayal and risks to our relationship security Rebuilding trust takes time and effort for both parties On your end you may need to provide more reassurance and more concrete evidence that you are trustworthy gestures of transparency eg  giving him more information about where you are going and who you will be with letting him know when you get texts or emails from people that might give him pause or trigger insecurities and more patience and empathy for his fears On his end he may need to learn to be with his insecurities and fears and ask for reassurance about your love and commitment in ways that do not lead to criticizing you attempting to control you or limiting your freedom If you are not able to come to agreements about how to put his fears to rest without it negatively impacting your life I would suggest getting some professional help from a marriage counsellor or couples therapist
"divorce, unhealthy dependency, detachment disorder, mental block, relationship issues, alcohol dependency, mental health disorders, seeking help, detachment from relationships, pattern, infant daughter, birthday, marriage, children, first wife, dating, research, answers, therapy, professionals, bipolar disorder, depression",This sounds really difficult and I can understand your motivation to get to bottom of why this behaviour has occurred  especially if your husband who sounds like he is an exhusband continues to have a relationship with you and your children With that being said  relationships and mental health are very complicated and you are unlikely to find the answers you are looking for In order for someone to be diagnosed with a mental illness or in order for them to identify what leads them to fall into particular patterns in relationship  they would need to be willing to seek help and honestly talk about their challenges something that you say your ex is not willing to do  While it might be a relief to understand what is going on with him  it might be more comforting for you to get support for yourself in processing your feelings and everything that has come up for you as a result of his choices
"cheated on me, hurt me very bad, poor health, hard time moving on",How has your husband acted since then Was he regretful How did you find out Did he confess These are all things that you want to consider Betrayal is very hard to get over so if its taking you awhile to get over know that this is normalHopefully youre husband has been very regretful and upfront and honest with you since this happened It may take awhile to reestablish your trust with him and he should understand this Its also very important to discuss WHY he cheated You want to make sure that the reasoning behind this was not something that could arise again in the future And if it can there needs to be an action plan in place ie being honest with how hes feeling so that you both get a chance to rectify the situationIf the cheating has happened more than once you may want to reevaluate your reasoning for staying in the marriage It would be obvious that he did not truly regret what he had done or else he wouldnt repeat the same mistake However if it was a single event and he has shown you and continuously shows you that he genuinely loves you and is sorry for his mistake I would give it a try People do make mistakes and sometimes it takes an event like this to realize what you haveKnow that it takes time and that you have the right to feel what you feel If the relationship was a good healthy relationship it is worth saving Ease back into it and be upfront with your feelings In return your husband should be patient and understanding of this Also marriage counselors are often a good goto as they have a great deal of experience working with marriages in similar situations Best of luck to you
"emotions, disappointment, happy, jealous, envious, anger, upset, selfish, petty, ruining relationship, disappointed, mad, move on",Its hard to let go of the dreams you had regarding your wedding and engagement This was something that you and most women think about for years so its understandable to be disappointed But please be aware that it is rare that any wedding is perfect You may envy your friends weddings but more than likely they had a few mishaps of their own andor it wasnt as perfect as they had planned it either However like you know the marriage is the most important thing How many women are envious that you are in a happy stable relationship I assure you that there are plenty Try to live in the present considering that dwelling on the past can still not change how you were proposed to or how your wedding day transpired Focus on what you can control NOW Perhaps you can plan an extravagant renewal of your vows or change the look of your ringI would also be upfront with your husband and explain why youve been short lately But after that close that chapter and move on It sounds like you have a wonderful companion and you certainly dont want to lose this due to a situation that is impossible to change

"bulimic, early 20s, start back to school, become an RN, need to get better, lose control, angry, anxious, eat and purge, help",Eating disorders usually result from a sense of insecurity about who the person is whether they are good enough compared with anyone else and whether the way they person lives is effectiveIf you have a style youre already happy with to reflect on these sorts of topics keep following your own logic with the aim to free yourself which usually takes place gradually from these sort of selfdoubtsThe other approach would be to find an unperson or an online discussion group where youd be able to offer and receive the support from other people who live with a similar problemGood luck in your studies
"binge eating, stress, overwhelmed, shame, disappointment, gym, exercise, coping mechanisms, break this cycle",HelloThis question describes a very typical setup of what is called the  Binge Repent Repeat cycle This means that typically after you binge you experience emotions as you described shame and disappointment and then because of these emotions you repent ie vow to never binge again promise to do better go to the gym etc and then ultimately end up bingeing again There are many coping mechanisms for binge eating and one of the best is actually attempting to NORMALIZE eating Meaning you need to attempt to eat normally eating appropriately portioned meals 3 times a day with snacks in between IF you binge then it may be helpful to remind yourself that when you attempt to compensate for your bingeing behaviors and you end up feeling restricted from over exercising or undereating then this actually leads to a binge again Thus reverting you back to the cycle If you binge it will be helpful to try and get back on a normal schedule of eating instead of trying to compensate for the binge Although it may feel counterproductive getting back on a normal eating schedule will prevent you from entering into the restrictive cycle It can also be helpful to remind yourself that the binge has already occurred it is in the past and the goal is to move forward without focusing on the past Focus on what you can do differently next time What emotions or situations led up to the binge What can you to do prevent or change the circumstances that led to the binge or the way that you handled the situation Lastly if youre struggling with normalizing eating it can be helpful to work with a professional that can provide counseling and coaching to help you learn how to eating normally mindfully and without feeling the guilt and other harmful emotions sometimes associated with disordered eating I would be more than happy to assist you if you ever have any questions or want to reach out to somebody You can contact me via my website httpwwwmaddenwellnesskycom
"self control over food, keep eating, pleasure of it, sweets, never done eating dessert",Hello Im so glad you decided to write in today This is such a great question and Im sure many others will relate to exactly what youre describing There are a few different ways we can look at in understanding your concern First I think its important to understand food is just food Food is meant to nourish our bodies provide us with energy and yes sometimes reserved for special occasions and celebrations But in many cultures we place a LOT of emphasis on food We have food at every gathering and every celebration Whats more people have come to almost EXPECT food to be present at any and every gettogether And if its not Well then forget about it I see this time and time again with my clients Donuts appear in the office and its almost like donuts have never been there before Must eat one or two However we need to remind ourselves that this occurrence or similar ones will not be the last time we can enjoy this particular food It is likely the office donuts have happened before and they will be there again on another day During these moments I like to have my clients employ a StopandThink method StopandThink about your goals before you eat Is this donut getting you where you want to be Also I have my clients ask themselves how special is this donut If the donut really is a special donut from the best bakery in town and youve never been there before then now might be a time to have the donut But if not it would be wise to pass and wait until that special donut Another aspect we need to remember about food is to think about what were getting from overindulging or overeating Are you trying to drown out other emotions Are you trying to feel better and the food gives you that feeling for a brief moment What ELSE is going on This can be determined by utilizing what we describe as a Thought Record A Thought Record involves tracking and identifying thoughts and feelings associated with food triggers By targeting the emotions we can then determine where theyre coming from as well as how to decipher them A therapist can also help you with understanding your emotions related to food and will be helpful in assisting you with the Thought RecordThe most important thing to remember is that food addiction can be a real problem for a lot of people If food is taking over your life and you are preoccupied and overwhelmed with knowing where to start please seek out help Binge eating is the most common eating disorder and impacts the lives of thousands There are lots of free resources and information on my website at wwwmaddenwellnesskycom In addition I offer individual coaching and counseling through my website and I would love to help Amber
"boy asked me out, said no, friends and family, weirdly, be with him, tell friends",Since youve decided to be with the boy who already showed you his interest then why not simply tell him you decided to accept his invitation to be togetherProbably your first concern about hesitating to accept this boy into your life due to the way you imagine your family may react if you do is the more complex matter to solveForming a relationship does bring up our values and the way these are different or similar to our own    At the same time we already have values which are rooted in those from the family in which we grew upYour dilemma of wanting to be with this boy shows there is a clash between your values as an individual including your choice of partner and the way your family understands the values which support being part of a coupleStay true to what you feel whether this comes from your family or the way you currently are evolvingThis will guarantee that your new relationship will be built on the values and person you truly are
"suffered many things, diagnose depression, feel like a part of my heart is missing, fill it in with objects, a woman",Maybe the reason is not having confidence in the love you give to yourselfPossibly you consider the quality of your selflove as inferior to love someone else gives youThe best way to push through to your own selfcomfort and acceptance is to be aware of this tendency so you can remind yourself to practice appreciating the unique love you give to yourself
"relationship, brief, good friends, upset, wrong",It is not the case of being right or wrong in my view If you are asking I believe you truly care for your boyfriend It seems like he is having difficulties in establishing trust in this relationship The ideal would be to come closer to his upsetness and to show him that you are there for him I hope all goes well Rossana Mag
"insecurities, overreacting, triggering, bad past relationships, trust, partner, emotions, symptoms, situations",Two paths are possibleYoure not overreacting and instead are genuinely sensing that something feels unsettled within your girlfriendYou are overreacting because you have difficulty accepting how safe and loving your relationship is with this personThe only way to find out is to start conversations with your girlfriend on how you feelThis will allow new light to open an answer as to the truthOnce you know what truly is going on between the two of you your selftrust naturally will grow stronger Selftrust will give you an accurate read of what and whom you are able to safely trust
"long distance relationship, girlfriend, feelings for another guy, crush, cope, deal with",I can only imagine how hard that must have been to hear On one hand most of us would say we want our partners to always be honest with us but on the other disclosures like this can lead to feelings of worry and inadequacy if were not careful So let me first of all say that it is very normal for human beings even very committed and happy partners to have moments where they notice an attraction for someone else Quite honestly the brain cant help it It sees something good looking and it pays attention And when we pay attention to something good our brains send out neurochemicals associated with that happy thoughtand we get a rush of what your girlfriend is labeling a crush The difficulty here is deciphering whether she was just attempting to honor her commitment to you by sharing this feeling OR if she is continuing to feed those feelings I would encourage you to thank her for being honest if you havent already and ask her to further describe the nature of these feelings and what shed like to do from here As weird as it is to say at the end of the day what helps the most is typically reassuring yourself that you WILL be okay not matter what That it is worth it to invest in your relationship and give it your all and if someday god forbid this woman chooses to walk away then she is not the one Will it hurt Of course But is it the end Hell no There are 75 billion people on the planet and I firmly believe statistically speaking alone there are at least several hundred thousand that could be AMAZING partners for you Cheering you onTamara Powell LMHCPS You might enjoy this excellent book by Esther Perel for further inquiry into the fascinating world of love and mating behaviors Mating in Captivity
"emotions, symptoms, situations, love, hurting, not moved on, mismatched actions",If I understand you correctly this maybeboyfriend has done a partial break up and wants to maintain a partial relationship  Is that ok with you  And if it is what does it cost you  He says hes done but still wants the connection  That seems to leave him free to explore other options but it doesnt allow you to do the same  Break ups are painful and I know youd like to avoid that  I get it that you feel attached to him  you have been in a relationship with him for 4 years so that makes sense  However loving him appears to be costing you a lot without much in return If you wait for him to define what he wants you could be on hold for a long timePlease dont wait another year to advocate for yourself  See a therapist who can help you figure out what you need out of relationships and why you have allowed yourself to be on pause   It is possible that once you get clear you will be able to have a true relationship with him  If not please dont settle for this  Take good care of yourself
"relationship problems, fix them, make things right, lose her, learn how to listen, get myself together",What an important question and the fact that youre asking it is a big step in the right direction To answer in detail would require having quite a bit more information about what relationship problems have occurred  that woke you up to the fact that youre not listening as well as you could and that youre running the risk of losing herGiven that I dont have all that information Ill offer one simple suggestion Your girlfriend is the expert on what she needs and wants in relationship You could simply say to her that you know you still have a lot to learn about how to have a good relationship and you realize youre not yet understanding what she needs and you really want to Then take a deep breath settle down and listen Dont argue dont interrupt dont judge listen Let her know what you understand and that youre open to hearing more learning more if youre not quite getting it yet and then listen some more Be present and curious about this person you love dearly and dont want to lose This is the first step toward intimacy

"liked him, called me lovely, called me pretty, didnt want a relationship, flirt with me",Well as disappointed as you may very well feel from hearing this guys answer you know he doesnt want a relationshipWhat type of move would you like him to makeIf you mean youd be happy to have sex with this guy and not a relationship then wait for as long as your patience allowsTo wait for him to change his mind that he does want a relationship doesnt have a very strong base on which to standIts possible to do this only consider the emotional price of your frustration to wait for someone to change their mind
"long-distance relationship, ideal man, attracted, lusting, more attractive men, marriage, wake up, fall in love, great relationship, lust, perfect guy, truly in love",Attraction is important but sometimes overrated Im curious about your comment that you are not as attracted as you should be  What is your measuring stick is for what you are supposed to feel in terms of attraction in a relationship Do you want to be sexually intimate Do you enjoy having sex with him Are you satisfied with your sexual relationship when you are with him The fact that there is lust for other more attractive men does not necessarily mean anything There will always be attractive men and more attractive men than your partner and these attractive men will be even more appealing when you are in a longdistance relationship far from the arms of your partner Loving someone does not mean that you stop being a sexual being who no longer notices and desires attractive men Attraction results from a number of factors beyond appearance  including the degree to which you feel emotionally open safe and connected and how in tune you are with each others bodies It sounds like you think very highly of this man everything else is perfect about him Maybe it is worth spending some more time together in the same place if that is possible before deciding on marriage or that you are not truly in love
"high school, switched schools, not seen, few years, good relationship, friendly, lot in common, courage, ask out",One way to make good use of the situation you describe is to prepare and rehearse within yourself the way youd handle a similar situation in the futureSince a lot of time has gone by since you and this girl saw each other on a regular basis right now youve got no idea if youd feel the same way about her today as you did a few years agoThe relationship does point out the priorities and values you hold for a potential partner  That you liked the friendliness you shared is good for you to recognize  This way you realize you like friendship as a relationship property  To have lots of similar interests is another quality you appreciate in a partnerThe more you know about what you do and dont like in a partner the greater your chance to notice these qualities in someone new who comes along your path
"recovery from drug addiction, fight, distant, fix the relationship",My empathy goes out to you Relationships are tough enough and im sure your partner being distant has been upsetting for you You are confused and want to mend the relationship with him but are finding it so hard to do Relationships require both people to work consistently in order to keep them happier but if it is only you that is actively trying to repair the relationship it can be emotionally draining Perhaps expressing you feel using I you statements can be beneficial Do not accuse him or use you statements like you are so distant  or you dont even careStart out sharing your feelings by saying I feel sad when you dont return my phone calls or I feel confused about our relationship ever since you have been keeping to yourself He may have a valid point or might have been hurt by the argument and retreated as a result of it Regardless of why use this time as a great opportunity to practice healthy communication If you think you are not ready for a conversation like that couples counseling can be excellent You will have a skilled facilitator guide the conversation and help you both communicate with one another
"afraid to be alone, make me happy, worked on myself, healthy girlfriend, didn't work out, no man peaks my interest, ready to date again, sparks my interest",Yes of course theres a reasonTheres always a reason for most dynamicsDepending on the nature and qualities of what changed as a result of your new self realizations you may be more deeply affected by your new awareness than how you imagined these would goSince you already are on the best road possible for yourself since this resulted from your own introspection keep trusting your own self work as to what develops and at what pace your relationship attraction qualities grow
"boyfriend saying done with me, leaving, still here, wakes up in the morning, acts like nothing happen, repeats every night",Do the two of you ever talk over why he does this or your reaction to itAre you asking your question because his behavior upsets you or only out of curiosity to understand him betterBasically first know your own reason for your question   Then go ahead and tell him if what he does bothers you  In the best of cases he doesnt realize how his actions affect you and he will change
"boyfriend, on and off, dated, broke up, cant move on, get back together, wont talk, what should I do",Probably being sad to lose the relationship would be a good next move for youWhen a relationship ends the daily life structure changes significantly  A break up means adjusting to differences in everyday life not only that the person is no longer connected with usSince your boyfriend isnt talking to you then youre keeping yourself sadder than necessary to not accept his actions  Theres nothing you or anyone else can do change the fact that when someone decides to stop talking this person is the only one whos in charge to start talkingMaybe since youve had several breakups w this person that you require more time to pass before youre willing to accept that his changed interest in the relationship is permanentBe patient with your uncertainty as to whether he will or will not resume the relationship  Once enough time passes so that youre considerably past the point at which you and he come together then accepting his leavetaking will feel naturalRight now its very understandable to have hope since youve been on this road before  In time youll have your answer as to whether your future is with him or not

"hurtful, resolving the problem, swallow my pride, broken family, communicate",Under duress the very youngest parts of you and your boyfriend emerge So while you still look like grown ups your actions and words are motivated by very early preverbal parts of both of you In simple terms it is as if two infants somehow acquire the ability to say words but they are motivated by very basic early wounds that were created due to deficits in what was able to be done for each of you and likely understandable in terms of caregivers life experience and that still fell short of what you needed You are both still trying to get very early needs met The best advice I can offer is to try and remember this as early as possible when things start to heat up and then restrain expression that you already know leads nowhere helpful And seek out a therapist who can help you to work with these early issues and can support you to grow and develop from this stuck pointAvraham Cohen PhD RCC CCC
"dating, friend, exboyfriend, broke up, devastated, rough patch, relationship, in love, wants me back, hurt, boyfriend",Hello The dynamics of having a romantic relationship with someone is not always clear Sometimes we jump from one relationship to another without giving ourselves a chance to adjust and grieve for the one we had to leave behind When you find yourself in a situation where a previous partner is coming back into your life and desires to be with you again it is important to ask yourself what the motivations are prompting that return Is the person afraid of being alone Are they jealous of your current relationship Do you feel the same way about this returning relationship as you did before it was ended How long andor how committed is the current relationship you are in now with your current partner Does your former partner not like being dumped and maybe they just want to get back together with you so that they can dump you instead Some of these questions you may not be able to answer and some of them might require your own internal reflectionYou likely want to make a good decision and you also might want to consider who it will impact and how that will happen Other friends might be upset at this sudden change and it could create a strain on your friendship You will want to carefully consider the value of that friendship before you take any actions that could damage it Also perhaps think about what led you to end the relationship with your previous partner in the first place Has there been a change in events or behavior that would cause you to think of a valid reason to give that person a second chance How it will it impact your current relationshipGoing into relationships should be done with reflection patience and full awareness Ultimately you choose who is in your life so you want to make those choices based on appropriate decision making and with the ability to protect yourself from harm No one else can make this choice for you However gaining the insight of friends or family can be helpful as can seeking out the counsel of a therapist In your heart you will likely find the right answer Learn to trust that more as that is where the core of emotion tends to be when you need it Use your mind to analyze things but allow yourself to also feel your way through the situation too The answer will arrive if you let it
"boyfriend called me, particular profanity, broke up, third time, completely done, giving him chances, bothers me, overreacting",It sounds like you are reacting to an issue in communication patterns rather than a particular word  The ability to listen considerately to your partner and to have your partner listen to you is one of the keystones of a successful relationship  If your partner is not listening to acknowledging and remembering your wishes that is likely an indicator of some fissures in the foundation of the relationship
"emotional wreck, boyfriend in Ireland, 11 days",It sounds like you and your boyfriend are very close  Do you typically spend most of your time together  If so it may be important to reflect on how you feel when you are apart  If any separation is difficult you may need to examine why  Think about what it is that you miss and what you are anxious upset or worried about  If you examine the causes of your distress you likely will experience some relief   It is important to learn how to be happy when you are alone it will only improve the way you feel when you are with your boyfriend
"high functioning autism, dating sites, meet me, match, zoosk, luck, boyfriend, relationship, meet someone",Are there dating sites for people who have autism on the high functioning endIf not then find out the names of different organizations which support people who have autism  At least one of these groups will have some guidance as to social activities for dating or even specific sites for dating when autism is a criteriaAll the rejection on dating sites is rough for anyone to handleHow do you know that youre being passed over by guys who are on dating sites because you have autism    Any reason is possibleUnless youve heard from a few particular guys that their reason for looking beyond you is because of your autism it is possible youre in the same boat as everyone else who feels similarly frustrated by dating site rejection
"long distance relationship, two and a half years, saw his phone, people he texts, female coworker, approach this situation, ask him",I agree with Sherry that in a close intimate relationship you are entitled to ask questions about his relationship with significant others These questions help couples to build connection and trust Its based on the idea that if you reach out to him for whatever reason support openess understanding empathy you can count on him and can expect him to be responsive How he responds to your question will give you an idea whether he helps you to feel more emotionally secure and builds trust or if you feel that you cannot be open with him If your partner responds in an open and understanding manner it usually indicates that he cares about your feelings and values your importance If he responds in a defensive manner it could mean that he does not like that you are questioning your trust in him or that he has something to hide Either way you may wish to explain that building trust is something that is very important to you in a relationship and that talking to him openly helps to foster that If he continues to be defensive or evasive then there might be some bigger issues at stake and the two of you may benefit from couples counselling or having a discussion about the values that are important to you in the relationship and how the two of you will go about supporting those values with actionsDr Virginia ChowwwwPsychologyResourceca
"love, complicated, afraid, long distance, military, relationship going",Hello You are asking a very good question about how to sustain a longdistance relationship Although maintaining a longdistance relationship has its challenges with the proper communication commitment and understanding many longdistance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connection Without knowing more about the complicated nature of your relationship I wonder whether your boyfriend has given you reason not to trust him that makes afraid that he will find someone else Has he cheated on you in the past and has shown romantic interest to another person that made you fear losing him  Or is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence Knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future The more you focus on what if situations the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecure However if there is reason for you to question his fidelity you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a longdistance relationship To help the conversation you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust Is that you wish him to contact you regularly or to include you more in his life or to make a clear commitment For many of my clients in my private practice that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text phone and Skype Its hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner and its hard to build a relationship when you dont know whats going on in your partners life Other times it is Making sure they talk often to their longdistance partner so that they can participate in each others lives and to feel their presence Regular communication understanding and caring is the key to sustaining any relationship but this is especially true for longdistance ones Dr Virginia ChowwwwPsychologyResourceca
"losing it, questioning sanity, secret cell phone, holding a conversation, talking to himself",A rare topic  likely extremely troublesome for you I would need to have more background information on the two of you before beginning to offer any insight Feel free to email meI would also like to add that aside from the reality of whether or not these conversations are actually occurring as your partner he should be just as concerned about something that is disturbing you to this level  Partners need each others trust and support no matter who is right or wrong
"female friend, crazy, stop talking, answer the phone, suspicious, girlfriend, believe, understand",We women really do tend to struggle with the comparison game And Hollywood culture hasnt helped with romantic comedies and song lyrics telling us that when a man appears evasive theres something to worry about Its been my clinical experience though that most women value transparency and security in their relationships So you might try sharing a little bit more about your history with this woman For exampleWhere did you meet herHow long were you friends before you decided to call it quits Why dont you want to be friends with her ie what do you mean by kind of crazy I promise this tends to matter to womenWere you ever intimately involved with or even attracted to herIf your girlfriend can truly see that you view her as the filet mignon to the other womans hamburger and that she is your favorite person on the planet and has NOTHING to worry about she may start to come aroundNow IF shes more concerned that you might be taking this womans calls behind your back while Im not typically a huge fan of sharing passwords or phone records you might print them off and highlight this females number and show your girlfriend that you absolutely are telling the truthAnd if you really want to step it up I would be intentional about doing all the little things that you know your girlfriend loves that helped make her fall in love with you in the first place eg little love notes for her to find or sweet text messages buy a rose or her favorite flower have her car detailed do the laundrydate nightsyou get the idea  Bottom line  show your girlfriend why out of all the women on the planet that you could be with you CHOSE HER  And would continue to do so all over again  AND why you love HER as a person  This will help her trust what youre saying Best of luck to you  Tamara Powell LMHC
"toxic relationship, emotional abuse, verbal abuse, feel trapped, cannot be happy, get away",Im glad you recognize your own best interest and that your life will be much better without verbal and emotional abuseOne of the terrible results of being abused in a relationship which is expected to be loving safe and supportive is that the one who is being abused starts to question their own judgement rights opinions overall way of thinkingThis happens because partners who are intimately involved with one another are very meaningful  Regardless of how irrational wrong mean selfish intimidating thoughtless a partner is to the other the person on the receiving side gradually starts questioning whether they are wrong for not accepting these sorts of interactionsStick with what your own intuition tells youThere is a part within each of us which knows the truth of what is going onLeaving a relationship is always difficult to some degree  People are in familiar patterns of daily behavior no one wants to suddenly be alone even if this only means showing up as a physical body not as a truly loving partner no one wants to start telling others about a breakup answer questions about it feel blamed worry what others thinkThese are secondary matters to following the truth in your own heartListen to yourself about leaving this guy Your inner self does not lie to you
"chemistry, distant, feeling, scared, lose, freaking out, answer, bad happened",People often care deeply for those whom they love I dont know how long you have been together It is also common to want to be very closely connected to people who are important to youIt may be helpful to have a conversation about talking more or talking about how you feel when he is not there and how he feels about answering you right away It may be helpful for both of you to listen to each other and what you are feeling and experiencing so that you can look at what may work for both of you For example maybe you could remind yourself that he will answer you when he is not busy or as soon as he canSometimes just talking about these feelings can be helpful so that you can both have open discussions about whether the amount or type of communication is too much or in a style that is not working for both of you You could also consider leaving text messages or something that does not require an immediate response so that when he is busy you have the ability to write a message and he has the ability to answer when he canI also wonder where you are getting the idea that something bad happened I dont know whether something happen with this person in the past or perhaps at another time in your lifeSome people benefit from ideas such as not going to bed angry but this is difficult for othersI would suggest considering what makes each of you feel loved valued appreciated or specialAlso think about what styles of communication you both like and what is and is not okay in the context of an argumentIt may be difficult to talk about what has related to him being distant and it may be helpful to talk about ways to communicate about this first such as taking a 10 minute timeout if it becomes overwhelmingPerhaps talking with a therapist who specializes in couples would be helpful if talking about this between you is confusing or if you do not both feel heard by the other person Remember that feeling heard does not mean that you have to agree with one another
"abusive situation, bad things, early 20s, ex's parents, making me look like, left my ex",Maybe you can talk with your partner about this first look at the different elements of a possible conversation in the future If you are at a place where you are willing or able to disclose the reason that you left your ex that could be one element of the discussion but it doesnt have to beI dont know how long we have been together with your current partner but perhaps his or her parents would see you for who you are and make their own opinions over time That may be a discussion to have with them as wellHopefully your partner will be a good sounding board before these conversations
"anxiety, fights, calm, drinking alcohol",Because of the way that you say your boyfriend is only calm when he is drinking and you have concerns about flights it would probably be most helpful for you to speak with a local therapist so you can have specific conversations about what happens during these fightsWhen you do everything right are you saying that you dont argue It sounds a bit as though you are trying to read each others mind without being able to communicate effectively I recommend working on this with a therapist though even if you end up going without your boyfriend to sessions so that you can talk about specific strategies and what you can do when he is not calm
"loved the idea of loving someone, spending my whole life with them, treated everyone nice, spend every second with them, ends the same way, like you as a friend, love your attention",Attention is often something that is both wanted and sometimes not wanted all the time Maybe when youre in a relationship with someone you can discuss the amount of attention that you are both comfortable with andor what you are both looking for as far as amount of connection
"love, problems, long term, feelings, butterflies, heart beats fast, texted me, boyfriend",There are different types of attraction  You said that youve never felt this sort of feeling of your heart beating faster with your current boyfriend Depending on how long youve been together and if youre looking at different ways of making a life together and getting to know each other on a deeper level thats a different stage in a relationship and sometimes it feels different Some people look at it as a difference between levels of passion and compassion but there are many different terms to try to talk about itPerhaps with this guy that you really love you could talk about ways to keep things new and different in the relationship Maybe you can leave notes for each other during the day or have a small surprise at random intervals maybe an invitation to a picnic for exampleAs for the other guy who makes your heart beat faster what do you see in him You said you really love the other guy which is why Im askingWhat do you look for in the person who you want to be with longterm whoever that is
"exboyfriend, back and forth, late 20s, divorced, narcissistic behaviors, lies, cheats, love him, date other people, go back",There are a lot of pieces to the decision of whether to stay or leave Can you have open conversations about your concerns Is he able to listen to that Im not sure how you know for sure that he lies and cheats but does he recognize these things as problems Which part of you is bigger the part of you that wants to stay or the part of you that wants to leave Can you consider what you want wish for and desire while also considering the same for him Can he do that for you
"feel like, putting more into it, not getting reciprocated, lingering in the back of my mind",The most crucial key to any relationship is that mutual feeling you hold between you both that you matter Sounds like you are stuck in a cycle of hearing your ex say you dont matter Thats why it didnt work with him btw He wasnt reflecting to you that you mattered However it ended clearly though thats the sentiment thats lingering with you So here you are hanging around a new man why is telling you the same message Move on You arent unworthy you just havent found a man who is worthy of you To be worthy of you he must see your worth Often though before anyone else can see your worth you have to believe it
"past relationship, blame, bad, want to get past",We humans are social beings We learn how to BE in relationship as children The caregiving you received or didnt receive set the stage for how you show up in all your adult relationships Insecurity in relationships often has much to do with feeling unheard or unseen perhaps feeling like you dont matter There are many ways to rewire these relational patterns the first step of which is taking pause and noticing that you are feeling insecure  so congrats on that because clearly you are already there  Next Id suggest finding a relationship therapist to help you sort through your insecurities either as a couple or individually
"erectile dysfunction, suffering, tried Viagra Cialis, sexually frustrated, okay to have sex with other men",Hi First and foremost I want to acknowledge your efforts to gain your ideal erectile function If the medications are not working and you have taken them as prescribed I would encourage you to seek the help of a sex therapist as the dysfunction may be due to a psychological andor relational issue rather than a physicalmedical one As for your question only you can answer this Is it OK Are you OK with her sleeping with others Have you thought through what this may look like feel like become for you and her Opening up a relationship is a choice only the people in the relationship can answer Even then the answer may change at any point by either of you I encourage you to also determine what the intention is underneath your telling your girlfriend she could sleep with others Be clear with the intention and then together have continuous conversations about the expectations of opening up ie are there any kinds of sex that is off limits areas of the body where touch or intimacy is not allowed are uses of safer sex required or not do you want to know the details or not so forth An excellent resource would be the book Opening Up by Tristan Taormino I wish you the best of luckDr Lily Zehner MFTC
"addicted to porn, early 40s, overcame addiction, separation from wife, 15 years",The person who can answer this question is the person you want to rebuild that trust with  They are the only one who can tell you what it will take for them to trust you again  What they tell you may seem hard or impossible but unfortunately that is what THEY need  It is up to you if you feel and know you can provide what they request
"anger issues, deep insecurities, improved, counseling, individual sessions, broke up, constant questions, accusations, draining",From what you write youre not too happy with how your boyfriend treats you and how he handles his own lifeWhat keeps you feeling connected to him in positive waysIf youre truly not happy most of the time in this relationship then youre at the time of asking why youd want to remain in a relationship which is draining
"crush, talked, graduated, good note, message, too late",Youll only find out whether or not it is too late by following through with wanting to message himRegardless of whether the response you receive is what youd hoped to hear including not hearing back from him you will have done yourself a great honor and respect by following through on a wish and curiosity youve had for some time
"emotions, symptoms, situations, mad, talk everyday, slowing me down, personal situations, great moments, wanna be with him",It sounds like youre pulling away instead of being honest If you really want to be with him why not now If you dont have time for a relationship why are you dating at allI dont understand the whole phasing out thing that people do these days or ghosting where you just stop talking and disappear I get the sense that this relationship isnt working for you but for some reason youre stopping yourself from being honest with yourself and him and just ending it In the early stage of a relationship the first year if it doesnt feel fabulous its a good idea to move on Its not personal You dont owe this person anything They deserve someone whos totally into them and so do you and youre doing him no favors by hanging on to something thats not amazing or giving him hope that it might work better in the future sometime You dont have to slowly bow out It actually creates more hurt than gentle honesty Maybe people dont know how to say itIve decided not to continue with this I wish you the best Life is too short
"antidepression medicine, lot on his mind, time to think, dating, like him",Give him the time and space he needs  Obviously something is going on with him that he needs time to process think about and work through  Respect that most men are not talkers but more thinkers  If and when he is ready to talk he will  When and if he does talk be a comforting listener and put yourself in his shoes the best you can to be the support he needs  Dont take it personal because you just been dating 3 weeks and his depression maybe something that been going on for a while  If you do like himshowing him by being patient and supportive at this time
"big argument, wanted to work it out, asking others, leave me, wait on him to mature, talk to other people, come back in four years, pregnant, feel alone, handle this situation",Well as far as your boyfriend sounds like he has received advice from others that is not wise advice  Leaving is not the answer after a big argument as you mentioned  However this is not surprising to me based on his possible age and maturity level  Having a baby is a lifetime responsibility and there are very few who handle this or who realizes that it requires one to step their game up  This is something that he has to realize and be encouraged by his parents or a mature adult to do  Hopefully someone who has better wise advice will talk to him and he will listenAs for you  how do you handle this situation is your questionyou do what you have to do to prepare for your baby with or without him  A lot can happen in four years and you dont have time are not required and cant wait to see what will happen with him  You have a LIFE to prepare for  to feed to protect and to love  Can you tell your baby to wait I dont want to deal with you now I need to mature I will be back to see you later Hope you will be fine  Nope   As I always say you are not alone because there is someone somewhere going through the same or similar thing  Develop healthy friendshipswhether with family friends or new people who may enter your life  Your support system will grow and life will go onwith or with him  Stay focus on you and your baby
"emotions, symptoms, issues, talking to people, feeling paranoid, voices, loud, staying away from people, feeling worthless, not fitting in, waking up",Sounds like you are dealing with a lot within your self which is causing you great pain  I would suggest that first you get a full physical evaluation to make sure that you are ok physically  Then getting a mental evaluation as well from a psychiatrist  Seeing both would help rule out any physically or psychologically causes to your symptoms    After getting these evaluations your physician should be able to help guide you on what treatments would be the best to help with your everyday challenges your are facing  Whether treatment includes medication andor psychotherapist would be discussed  Please consider doing both immediately so you can have the live you want everyday you wake up
"sex life, out of the picture, thinking about, other girl",Orbetter yet Is it you still thinking about the other girl  I am sure his cheating hurt you emotionally and may have affected your sexual performance as well  Make sure the other girl is out the picture on your end as well  Sounds like something the both of you need to have a calm and adult conversation about
"relationship, mistake, married, broke up, divorced, forgave, sorry, love, second chance",Hey it might be mistake in the end but this is a risk you want to take and you get to make your own mistakes Your mom wants to protect you I get that Maybe she is worried youll be hurt again Were you hurt in some way by him Can you understand where shes coming from Sometimes when were mad at our partner and we complain about them to mom its hard to know how to repair moms relationship with the partner when things are better and we reunite Can you help your mom understand that you take responsibility for your part in how it went wrong that the picture you may have painted of him isnt the total picture She might need help there Thank your mom for her love and care and you can also let her know clearly that you and your boyfriend are the only ones who get to decide whether youre together or not that its a risk you are going to take and that you really need her support

"emotions, hurt, love, serious, close, missing, hot, in love, crushed, torn, confused, extreme pain",That sounds really heartbreaking It is tough falling in love and not being able to dive fully because of complications on the other side It sounds to me that you are doing exactly what you need to be doing by taking care of myself while the rest sorts itself out While I admire your desire and courage to stay friends  the extreme pain that you mentioned may make this too challenging and at odds with your taking care of yourself Since there is no commitment on her end to give it a shot with you I would make sure that you really honour your own feelings about what feels right to you so that you dont end up feeling strung along or resentful Make sure that you lean on friends and family at this time  we need all the support that we can get when we are heartbroken

"seeing this guy, step back, in contact, time together, holidays, dating site, signals crossed, honest, helped me, interested in dating, apologies, want him in my life, part of my life",It sounds like there is a bit of confusion regarding how you two feel about each other Do you know what type of relationship you want with him A friendship only casual dating or an exclusive relationship I would encourage you to first figure that out and then communicate to him how you are feeling Ask him to be honest with you about how he feels and what he wants from your relationship as well Be mentally prepared for a variety of responses from him so that there are no major surprises By clearing the air and learning what your own and each others desires are you can then move forward with a plan Without that clarification there will likely be false assumptions unanswered questions and confusion

"emergency room visit, Xray of spine, boyfriend, waiting, frustration, anger, bickering, misunderstanding, late picking up",It is extremely frustrating when our significant other doesnt understand our points of view Often times arguments are not the best opportunities to try and make a point as strong emotions can get in the way of understanding others perspectives Try having a discussion with him about what is bothering you during a time when neither if you are upset or arguing Communicate how you feel without placing blame and without yelling Addionally give him ideas of what he can do differently so that he understands what your expectations are Lastly consider seeing a couples therapist who can assist with teaching more effective communication techniques Best of luck
"trust issues, cheated on, hiding phone, texting ex-girlfriend, two kids, what should I do",Oh Chino I only have half the picture here so I will be cautious Theres a chicken and an egg and I dont know which came first One thing I see clearly is that your fiance will always have to have communications with his ex because they have children Can you accept that When suspicion and insecurity come along your job is to look at the big picture and the real picture Is there any real evidence that he is cheating Remember that texting his ex is not evidence alone if the communications are about the kids Has he earned your trust If so then its not fair to punish him for the betrayals of others Hes not your ex Reassure your heart that you are his priority if the larger evidence supports that At the same time you can let him know what your triggers are For example hiding his phone doesnt send you a good message right See this is the chicken and the eggis he hiding the phone because youve been overreacting when he gets a text  So let him know you wont blow up about him getting a text if he doesnt conceal or password his phone Transparency helps build trust You have sensitivities and it helps you a lot if hes aware of them and willing to try not to do things that trigger fear Let him know when you get scared and hopefully hell give you the openness and security you need in order to trust him and act as if you trust him
"changing her, less important, hurts, support, hard, important thing, relatively sober, fraternity party, worry, regretful, love, rough patch",You may already be doing as much as possible for your relationshipEach of you are 50 of the relationshipIs the 50 which your GF contributes to your relationship based on the same understanding of the couples problem as you haveMaybe a good starting place for the two of you to talk about is defining what problem the two of you have as a coupleThis way each of you will be able to know if you have similar values and definitions of your reasons for being togetherDepending on what you each expect from your partnership you each will clearly know whether and then how to accommodate the other personThese discussions stir a lot of emotions in each person so that sometimes staying clear minded becomes very difficult  You both will likely feel like talking about these matters more than one timeConsider utilizing a professional credentialed and licensed therapist who would help the two of you stay on track with examine your emotional connections in a fair and safe wayGood luck with understanding and appreciating your relationship
"exboyfriend, closure, sexual tension, age difference, good match, girlfriend, connection, closure, move on, current boyfriend, marijuana, racing mind, talk it out, blow up, crushed, move forward, cut off, help",If youre in a relationship and youre having strong thoughts about someone else its important to pay attention to that Although you say youre happy Id suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether youre getting everything you need Is there a physical connection with your ex that you dont have with your current boyfriend It could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas but that you just dont feel excited about him for some reason Thats a pretty important element to be missingIt may be that even if you are happy with your current boyfriend you still hold something special for your ex If you feel the need to see what is possible there I think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first You cant have everythingIf you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship The grass isnt greener A therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present rather than an imagined version of the past or future
"love, first time, acted, left, saying goodbye, heart burning, pain",Ouch Losing someone you love hurts so much We all long to be loved and to love and to have that experience and then lose it is awful While it is easy to feel angry or start doubting yourself under these circumstances I would encourage you to recognize the agony of what you are experiencing as an indication of how much you value loving relationships and how much you want to make this happen in your life When we are going through this kind of loss it is really helpful to have the support of friends and family While no one is going to be able to make it better we dont have to be alone with our pain If you are not comfortable with going to those in your life it may be a good time to see  a counsellor to help you cope with your distress and learn how to move past this and find the love that you are looking for
"trust issues, cheating, pregnant, lost the baby, afraid, hurt, love, happy, family",Im truly sorry to hear that your relationship is causing you such distress at this time When we are in relationships trust is so integral to our satisfaction within the relationship  Often when we feel we are required to prove ourselves feelings of resentment can replace those feelings of wanting to be supportive  In situations like this I often recommend being open and honest in your communication with your partner  Your fears about his response are valid as he made an assumption which you cannot disprove because you cannot battle against a shadow fact If you feel comfortable doing so you can always ask him why he is so concerned you are unable to remain faithful and challenge those beliefs with the facts that disclaim them  You can also ask your partner what it is that he needs from you to help you to help him trust in your responses  In the end these are issues that you cannot conquer for him  you can only guide him and show him the path towards trust  You may suggest couples counselling or that he seek out a professional to talk to as well  But in terms of your question only you can decide whether you feel you can remain in a relationship in which you defend yourself against an uncommitted offense
"harassing, stalking, angry lies, needs help, move on, accusations, believe them to be true",The specific laws about this will vary from state to state  Generally the only way to force someone to get mental health care is if they pose an imminent theft of harm to themself or someone else or if they are unable to care for themself  More importantly is dealing with your safety  Most states have laws that make stalking a crime You might want to think about filing a police report and obtaining a restraining order against him  You could also think about contacting a local counselor While you cant force him to get help with moving on from the relationship counseling could help you to deal with what is going on
"sneaky, puts friends before me, fights, happy, mean, blames me, cant admit faults, perfect, does no wrong",Hi Ontario I live in the other Ontario in Canada Ill try to help you sort this out You have a long list of complaints about your boyfriend It sounds like hes maybe a bit immature and moody and these things affect you for sure I get it Its got me curious and if I was working with you Id want to know a lot more about how long youve been together and whats actually working well between you two I would also ask a lot of questions about the details of your description What tells you hes sneaky Does he lie How do you know he lies to you Also are you wanting to make things better with him do you just want an ear to vent to are you looking for validation or do you hope someone will help you wake up to an unhappy situation  It helps me if I know what you wantWhenever I meet someone who has a lot of complaints about their partner or boyfriend I encourage them first to look at the language theyre using Some of your words tell me that you think you know what hes thinking that he wants to fight so he can leave that he thinks hes perfect Its always tricky when we assume what someones thinking and in an argument or dialogue these kinds of statements tend to lead to defensiveness and an escalated argument Id encourage you to focus on his actual behaviours and how they affect you rather than the motives or beliefs you think are behind the behaviours because you really cant know what hes thinking unless he tells you As a general rule the When you do X I feel Y sentence goes far in helping others understand what we feelSo its fair to say when you lie to me I cant trust you or when you end our date early to hang with your friends I feel like Im not important to you or your mood swings are difficult for me or I dont seem to get apologies from you Try to focus on his actual behaviour when you talk to him about this stuff A relationship counsellor can help you each understand the other better beyond the surface behaviours if you want to improve the relationshipThat said I have to askif you havent been with Mr Not So Great for very long is it maybe time to rethink the relationship Unless there is a balance of really loving and positive behaviours that youre leaving out you dont seem happy A good therapist can help you understand why you are stuck in an unhappy relationship if that is whats happening Theres a lot to sort out herehow to communicate about your needs how to know when to call it quits if something doesnt feel good I wish you the best as you continue to examine these questions with assistance from friends or professionals
"emotional, overwhelming feeling, cheating, accusing, wrong, feeling down, not confident, texted, hook up, working, out of the line, crazy, need help, checking, something wrong",Trust your intuition that your boyfriend is involved with other peopleYou gave examples which strongly suggest thisQuite commonly a person twist someones words to convince then of having problems in seeing or understanding their own and others behaviorYour intuition is again working quite well in telling you that your problem is having a boyfriend who manipulates you not that youre seeing things incorrectlyOne way to check if youre totally misreading him is to examine whether you feel similarly in other relationshipsIf no one else who knows you tells you that youre crazy then this strongly points to your boyfriend twisting words so that you feel wrongAlso a consult with a therapist would clarify the dynamics between you and your boyfriendA therapist session would also allow you to think out loud in a confidential discussion what to do with your newfound clarity
"insecurities, not being respected, ex, boyfriend, cheating, lying, other woman, holiday plans, child, let go, wonderful boyfriend",How much of your unhappiness with your boyfriends way of handling himself regarding his ex have you told himThe topics that upset you are the core of any intimate relationshipThe good news is your own awareness of priorities and expectations from a partnerThere may not be any bad news depending on whether your boyfriend has the interest to adjust what he does regarding the exTalking the matters you list may open a lot of emotion and become sidetracked very easilyA couples therapist whose focus is on the couple not either of you as individuals may be useful to you and your boyfriend so that you are able to complete your discussions without getting lost by the emotions raised

"best friend, beautiful baby girl, love, late teens, lost connection, talking to a random guy, hurt, confused",Congrats on having your daughterHave you told your partner about your feelings of hurt and confusedThis is one possible way of opening a conversation about the different ways you each feel about one another and whether either of you would like changing or continuing to live together in light of the change in emotional connectionThe first step of having a dialogue about a relationship is being clear on what you are feeling what you are willing to contribute to the relationship and what you would like having in return from your partnerAsk your partner if she is willing to have a conversation on these topics  Then allow some time so each of you is clear about their own expectations and what is possible to offer the otherThis is a fairly complex process and very often is difficult to keep on track without outside help to keep the discussion focusedIt is normal for emotions to override our logic when discussing matters we care about deeplyIf the conversations dont go very far or if your partner has no interest in talking stick with your own interest to more fully understand mattersInterview some therapists to find one whom you feel helps you clarify and find direction for yourself about this situation
"attracted, older men",What a wonderful questionGood for you on clearly knowing your prioritiesIf I was sitting with you now Id ask you to list your reasonsStart with whatever answers you do come up with and examine each of these a little furtherIf for example you feel you need a man because many of your friends are in relationships then possibly you feel insecure about being your unique self even when this sets you apart from your friendsIf you feel you need a man to protect you financially then possibly youve lost faith in your ability to financially support yourselfIf youd like a man in your life to offer your love and are willing to contribute the work of relating intimately then youve found the best reason for wanting a man in your lifeThis is far different than need

"great sex, liking her, just be friends, cant stop thinking, always on mind, want her back",It can be really difficult when someone you care about doesnt feel the same about you The most important thing to remember is that you can not make her feel a certain way  There is nothing you can do to force her to want to be in a relationship with youIn the end if she just wants to be friends then shes probably not the right match for youRemember every relationship ends  until that last one that doesnt  And that is how its supposed to be
"sensitive to stress, sensitive to a negative tone of voice, harmful impact, negative communication, self-fulfilling prophecy, frustrating, advice",With any type of criticism it is usually best to introduce the topic at a neutral time ie when both of you are relaxed with no current stressors involved having fun etc  Begin with a nonjudgmental reflective comment about a recent bothersome event as if it were just then crossing your mind therefore not something youve been consumed with ruminating over  eases the impulse for him to dive straight into defense modeThen share how you felt at the time of the event  Just say when I felt kind of hurt  shocked or whatever the feeling was  PERIOD  THATS ALL YOU SHOULD SAY  Wait for him to respond to your matteroffact statementNo matter what his response is stick to your same message  dont get overwhelmed by trying to rephrase or explain your view as that will likely set you up for continued arguing  You can even add I agree I could have misunderstood  it event I just know it made me feel uneasyHere you give him little wiggle room for a debateGood luck  Id love to hear how it goes
"feeling like, never be with anyone, no one would want me, couldn't have many friends, strange, want to be loved, hate to be, always lose",As a relationship therapist I work with a lot of people who feel similar feelings to some degree or another and almost always find that the origin of these feelings point back towards childhood How did you caregivers express or not express love towards you How did they express or not express love towards one another These early messages become your template for how you have learned to see yourself and what you expect from others In his book Wired for Love Stan Tatkin PsyD writes We learn to love ourselves precisely because we have experienced being loved by someone We learn to take care of ourselves because somebody has taken care of us Our self worth and selfesteem also develop because of other people  This could be very fruitful to explore in individual therapy with a relationship therapist who really gets it you may have to interview a few to find the right fit thats OK Maybe youd even want to read that book I linked above  Noticing this pattern is HUGE its where transformation begins And now that you have be kind with yourself it begins there too

"dog obsession disorder, problems with girlfriend, placing more importance to dogs, prioritize girlfriend",Hey dogs are cool They adore pleasing humans and often LOVE to work on learning what you want and expect from them Your girlfriend on the other hand likely has her own desires and needs that she attend to before tuning into yours You are good with dogs that tells me that youve spent some time observing their behavior The first step in working through this issue would be similar start to tune into and observe your girlfriend more often Observation is a skill when it comes to relationship building The skills you have mastered in relating with your dogs can carry over you will just have to relearn what behaviors you are watching And keep in mind that also means observing yourself in relationships
"losing feelings, love, obsessed, space, okay, better, stress, sad feeling, great guy, effort, talking, couple, advice",Im willing to bet that this isnt what you are hoping to hear but Id suggest giving him space Ooph thats a tough one right I know But heres the thing when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away He needs to feel like a solid and whole person as you do too to be able to be fully in your relationship Its the work of being in relationship to learn this I get that this is tough stuff I wonder outside of being with him how do you soothe and calm yourself Thats the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now
"trouble accepting, fix things",Being able to accept your partners influence is a key relationship skill And its very two sided  Chances are if you dont feel your partner is being influenced by you they likely dont feel you are being influenced by them either The best fix you can practice is to soften yourself into your partner and see how much more open you can be to their influence  Play with it
"emotions, silent treatment, frustration, uncertainty, relationship issues",In any relationship it is important to be able to say Im sorry because it shows vulnerability and openness I recommend that you sit and have a discussion with him now that you are calm about why you were upset and how you would like to handle such incidents in the future If you find yourself becoming upset again I encourage you to take a 20 minute break and then come back to the conversation once you are no longer heated Studies show that talking or discussing arguments are more effective once you have cooled down and you are more likely to hearunderstand what your partner is trying to convey
"abused emotionally, keep getting with men, emotionally abused, mistakes, hard time, getting back on my feet, help me",I want to applaud you for taking this first step towards realizing that this is an issue and wanting to do something about it  You are already on the road to a happier life with this realization  A lot of women do not recognize that it may be something about them that continues to attract a man like this and will only blame it on the men for treating them that way  Until you realize there is a problem you wont start looking for a solutionDont misunderstand me  The abuse is not your fault You are seeing a pattern though so this does need to be addressed First go and buy the book Boundaries Where You End and I Begin by Anne Katherine  Read it  This book describes many situations that are similar to yours describes how a person came to be that way and how to stop it  You will have to learn to set good boundaries in your life and to maintain themBe single for a while  Stay single until you feel like a whole healthy happy person on your own  Often we get in a relationship because of a need  If you feel like you need a person in your life to make you a whole person then you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons  The first step is to work on whatever it is in you that makes you feel like you need another person in your life  Identify those needs and then learn to fulfill them on your ownI was doing a couples therapy session and the husband was being emotionally abusive to the wife  This was a recurrent theme for her like you are saying it is for you  However she had been doing a lot of work on her own and in private therapy and this was a new relationship  Obviously she still had not gotten it right because she did once again attract a man with these tendencies  The difference this time was that she had done a lot of work on herself and had become a stronger person  When she looked at him in our session and said to him I dont need you I want you  But not if you are going to continue to act like this  So you leave the house and dont come back until you are ready to make some changes  She stuck to that too  He didnt leave for two more days because he kept telling her he would do different and begging to be allowed to stay  She had drawn a boundary and stuck to it and he left She was fully prepared to be single again  They actually did end up working things out in the endYou cant let someone stay and continue to treat you badly  Sure a marriage takes work and compromise on both sides  Couples therapy can help you both learn to communicate in a healthier way with each other and can help you realize what areas in the relationship need work  You may not realize how some of the things you say to him comes across and he may not realize how what he says does to you  A therapist can help you with this so that you both learn how your words can hurt But you need to know your boundaries and be prepared to stick to them and not compromise your boundaries  That means following through on the threat to leave when he continues to abuse you  Someone cant do that if they are too scared to be alone  If they feel they need the other person in their life These patterns are developed in early childhood from what we learn from our parents  When someone has grown up in a dysfunctional family it is all they know  Even when you can say that you realize it is a problem you still dont know how to stop it because you never learned any other way of interacting with people  Something that took a lifetime to learn will take time and work to overcome  Be patient with yourself and find a good therapist  You cant change your partner  Work on you and when you begin to heal and feel healthy the right people will come into your life and stay  The more you focus on trying to change the wrong ones to be what you want the more frustrated you will become
"emotions, in love, bored, relationship, want to go after, unsure, dilemma, what should I do",Hi there Wow this sounds like a sticky situation however Im here to help guide you through this decision First and foremost you must ask yourself if you ever loved your sons father or was it a situation to where you two got pregnant and stayed together for the child Its very common to stay with your partner when a child is involved regardless if love is involved or not because its the right thing to do Right Well not entirely Although staying with your partner because you have a child together may seem right in fact it hurts the child in the long run If you are not love with your partner you will show distance unhappiness sadness possibility of frequent arguments and cheating When a child grows up in the home and witnesses these types of emotions  behaviors it is unhealthy as heshe will expect their own relationships to be such As a responsible adult you are supposed to be there to shape and model the future for your child Just remember what you do your child will model Secondly do not sell yourself short from love Everyone deserves to be happy and to have someone to share their love and intimacy with However being in love with someone you have never seen before can be very risky Honestly that sounds like lust and the longing of love Humans have needs and when people are unhappy in their current relationship they often seek out what they need If you decide to pursue the second relationship I would suggest setting up an outing with a friend or two in order to get to know this person as there are a lot of scammers these days Finally I am not convinced that this has anything to do with choosing between two guys This seems as if you are making a decision to end the relationship with your childs father or not You should ask yourself if you were in love with your childs father first off If you were you would have never sought after love I hope this was helpful for you and I hope I was able to shed a different light on your situation Take care of yourself
"emotions, tired, judged, cheated, affectionate, love, reconnect, argue, lost, beautiful, baby girls, part-time, care, cook, internet, Christian counselor, speak",I dont think youve lost something I think youve found something  your breaking point and its about time Your boyfriend seems to be a very selfish and immature man who reconnects with you when its convenient for him Obviously he has his own issues but I want to address yours I agree you need to talk to someone The fact that youve put up with his repeated cheating and then letting him blame you for it by saying youre not affectionate enough etc tells me you probably have low selfesteem and have likely told yourself over the years that you dont deserve any better You do You may truly love this guy but based on his behaviors he does not love you not in the way you deserve  And although you may want to believe he can change he has proved over and over again that hes not willing to so you need to do what is best for you and your children What would you tell your daughters if someone was treating them this way Would you want your sons to treat women this way Thats what youre teaching your children when they see thisLike I said I agree that you should talk to someone You can ask your boyfriend to go too but my guess is he wont Even if he does you should still see someone individually to work on YOU I understand its not easy to just kick him out especially since you have children together but a counselor can help you talk through all the details while helping you raise your selfesteem and selfworth
"broke up, loves me, not in love, happy together, visit family, changed, missed family, quit job, drove 15 hours, apologized, pregnant, trying to get pregnant, hard to accept, treated her the best, losing my family, losing my mind.",I am sorry to hear of these troubles I see a few issues here I wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled Some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant and all this does is bring up more problemsYou say you never treated her badly and I believe you People in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on In fact giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a self outside of this relationship can be unhealthy It takes two whole healthy happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole healthy happy couple in a relationship Expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to workThere are two books that I recommend you buy and read One is Codependent No More The other is Can My Relationship Be SavedSometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone it makes you both miserable You cannot change her and cannot change her mind Sometimes the best thing is to let go If it is meant to be you will end up back together again It seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving I suggest backing off and letting her go Maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind If it is meant to be she will come back If not use this time to work on being a healthy happy you on your own
"interest in same sex, same sex encounters, confusion, self-discovery",What most people dont know is that sexual preferences can be fluid meaning our sexual orientation is not as fixed as most people believe  Women in particular tend to be more fluid in their desire to express and experience sex  It is not uncommon for heterosexual women in their midlife to explore new sexual appetites  That said men tend to be more rigid in their orientations particularly if they are hetero while gay men tend to be more fluid  So if your distress is over your new interests I would tell you you are not alone and not abnormal  Since you have started exploring enjoy and consider seeing a therapist to help you navigate your feelings around this new sexual life Warm wishes
"girl, bisexual, gay, like girls, boys, unsure",I would ask you do you feel like you need to come up with a label Is there something about identifying as one or the other that would be helpful for you From what current science has told us about sexual orientation its a spectrum There are people on the spectrum who are clearly gay or clearly heterosexual and then there is everyone in between which includes being bisexual which I guess in the spectrum would be smack in the middleIt may be too early for you to identify as any one thing on that spectrum as you say but I dont really know or maybe as you move through life you just wont identify as any one thing and thats totally okay The most important thing in my professional opinion is to accept yourself fully for whatever it is that you are The second most important thing in my professional opinion too is to be honest with yourself and your partners about however you do identify your sexual orientation
"What should I do, see each other",I am so sorry this happened  Sharing a part of your private life without your permission can be so painful  I might suggest depending on your relationship reaching out to your sister and discussing this or setting boundary that you dont want to discuss your private life  I might also speak with your wife and share how hurt you are and what you need to happen moving forward to begin to heal
"girl, boy, different variation of gender, confused, birth gender",Hi as an affirming gender therapist I like to let people know that like sexuality gender is a spectrum too  Its possible to look like a girl and feel more like a boy just as its possible to feel halfway between a boy and a girl or anywhere else on a horizontal line with two points between it  Some people use different pronouns or words to express their gender and thats okay  Its up to you to find out what is most comfortable
"rough time, upset, depressed, not normal, disgust, tough, scared, thinking, shake",Are you able to give yourself some peace of mind while you take the time to further address whether or not you are gayWhether or not and to what degree a person accepts their sexuality depends on dense factors such as the culture of your family the beliefs about gay people with which you were brought up and your own tolerance for being a unique individualExamining these factors whether inwardly by yourself in online blogs and sites or live with other people requires patience and effortThe more you are willing to commit to figuring out your own truth the greater is your chance of finding it
"emotions, torn, enjoy, fascination, kinky fetish interests, single",Let yourself enjoy crossdressingWhat sounds in your way are whatever beliefs you gre up hearing see and absorb currentlyConcentrate on your own satisfaction and that you are doing this in a nonharming wayMaybe if you branch out your interest by finding other people who enjoy crossdressing as much as you doWith any interest or activity social interaction supports it
"transition from male to female, wanted, persisted, 10 years, dont know where to start, soundest information",Wonderful  I am so excited for you  What a huge decision  I am writing from Toronto Canada so it is hard for me to direct you specifically  I would start with two things 1 Find a doctor that is comfortable perscribing hormones and 2 find a Counsellor or Therapist that is transgender specialized  They will know how transitioning works in your health care system and other supports as well  Google is a wonderful way to find these resources   I wish you well Thanks for writing
"middle school, high school, friends, family, gay, telling, believe, wanted, starting, believe, unsure",I agree with Amy We get a lot of pressure from others and even ourselves to define who we are and what we want at a pretty early age The truth is our sexuality can change and grow in directions we never imagined I may be wrong but I am getting the impression that you may not want to be gay That this is something you didnt like others suggesting and now you are uncomfortable with the idea that it may be true This would certainly be understandable Your sexuality is YOURS and yours alone It can be quite frustrating and hurful when others try to define who you are And it can be equally frustrating when you are trying to figure it out for yourself The truth is that there are many different possibilities when it comes to sexual orientation It may help to think about what qualities you find attractive What kind of person can you see yourself being attracted to Someone smart Funny Loves dogs If you look for these qualities in a person they may lead you to being attracted to someone of the same sex but maybe not At least you would be choosing someone based on values and qualities that you love and admire Another idea is to chat with a counselor if you are interested Preferrably one who has done some training in affirmative therapy Be well and be youRobin  J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC
"emotions, confusion, sexual orientation, identity crisis",It doesnt sound like you are finding yourself attracted to anyone  It could mean that you just havent connected with anyone you find attractive or that you are asexual  essentially not oriented toward anyone  I would suggest doing some reading on asexuality and see if it connects to how you feel
"transgender, friends, family, conversations, accept, gender dysphoria, difficult, strategies, dealing with",Hi It can be difficult to handle such a transition on your own I work with clients to understand their needs and wants This can involve how to communicate effectively with friends family and other loved ones or learning how to have selfacceptance I strongly recommend speaking with a licensed clinician one on one to help facilitate the change you are looking for
"enjoying, imagining, date a girl, find guys cute, bisexual",Hello  Thank you for your question  Exploring your sexual orientation and attraction is a wonderful opportunity to get to know yourself  I would be curious to know what feelings you might have related to the possibility of being bi What messages you may have received related to this orientation and any concerns you have about possible sexual orientations
"sick, throwing up, desire to be female, think about being a woman, pleasure from penis, women attractive, men attractive, ashamed","Hello and thank you for reaching out to ask for help Surely this is a very confusing time for you If you have never had these
feelings and desires it could certainty shake everything you thought you knew
about yourself 
My guess is that you becoming sick around the time that this
started is likely a coincidence but I understand how you would make the
connection 
I have a feeling that a few things may be going on here It
is really hard to say since I dont know you how old you are etc But I will
share you with you some thoughts 
Some people when they have undesirable thoughts that really
surprise them have a really tough time getting rid of them Our reaction to
the thought can be very strong and our tendency to try to block it out stuff
it avoid it etc is not always successful In fact its usually not 
Its like telling you not to think of pink elephants I
would be willing to bet that you thought of a pink elephant just now 
So rather than fighting thoughts that you find confusing
sometimes it is helpful to allow yourself to explore the thought with curiosity
and without judgement Where is this thought coming from What are my feelings
about it Asking yourself these questions may help you come to a resolution
about what is going on 
One possibility is that you have developed an anxiety about
your thoughts and now you are in the process of obsessing about them but
another possibility is that you are legitimately exploring your sexuality and
gender I get the feeling from your question that you do not want to believe
that it is second possibility And that is okay 
You can try some of my suggestions but you can also see a
counselor who may be able to help you work through your confusion I would
suggest someone who has experience working with sexuality issues You can
usually find out what a counselor works with on their website What is
important is that you find someone who is nonjudgmental about what you are
experiencing 
 
I wish you well

"teenage girl, straight, bisexual, gay, sudden rush of questions, don't know anymore",Being open minded about the type of sexual connection which feels true and real is a solid starting pointHaving questions is a very valuable way of more clearly defining your sexualityWrite one or two of your questions if youd like a more specific focus to your general search about your sexual preference
"transgender, thought, mind of a girl",Hello FrostproofThinking about becoming transgender and being transgender are slightly different  This is a topic that is best discussed with a therapist that specializes in LGBTQ issues  From what you have written it sounds as if you still have some confusion as to where you fit in with the labeling system  While labels provide a means to quickly identify and classify they can also feel restrictive or confining  Instead of focusing on fitting into a specific classification explore who you are as a person and celebrate your positive qualities and those things that make you uniquely you  There are many options for you to find a therapist and etherapy is also an option  You can try Breakthrough an online service   Here is some reading for refection that you may find helpful  Yin Yang Woman Man httpdldbzejVK2  What does it mean to be a woman or a man
"comfortable as a girl, like girls, stuck in a guy body, imagine myself as a girl, hot looking one, having boobs, act make more sense, feel like",I understand that gender andor sexual identity crises can be very difficult to navigate although in todays time I think we have made a lot of progress and it is becoming easier for individuals to find themselves and also find acceptance from societyI am unsure how old you are If you are a child or teenager this is a normal time to have identity questions and to be in a phase where you are trying to figure out who you are and what you want out of life I hope that you have understanding and supportive friends and family that you can talk to and who will support you in how you feel and what you may decide to do A lot of people unfortunately do not and if this is the case then it makes it harder for you Because then you may not feel safe exploring these feelings and decisionsI urge you not to try to make any permanent changes for quite some time By this I mean a sex change Anything permanent like surgery or hormone replacement to change your actual gender is something that does not need to be done lightly Please find a therapist that can help you explore your feelings and your identity crisis Of course there are things that you can do that are not permanent changes Many people decide to dress like their gender of choice Maybe experimenting in this way is something that you could doSee if you have a local chapter of PFLAG in your area PFLAG stands for Parents Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays They are able to help not only with those who identify as lesbian or gay but also transgendered and asexual I wish you all the best in your identity crisis It would be very easy for you to sink into depression if you do not have good support and understanding from those around you during this time Find a professional that can help especially if you experience depression or any thoughts of harming yourself
"confusion, inability to focus",One way to concentrate is that if your mind starts to wonder then remind yourself to bring your attention backStart with short time spans of expecting yourself to concentrate  Youll more likely succeed with concentrating with small time spans than longer onesOnce you start seeing your success this will motivate you to try increasing the length to expect yourself to concentrateThe task of selfreminding is the same whether for long or short time periodsAlso before starting this exercise ask your medical doctor if the problem can be related to a physical health problemIf there is then have the possibility ruled out that your difficulty concentrating comes from the mental ability to concentrate and not some medical reason preventing thisBefore someone can engage their psychological will there must be a clean medical body and mind with which to work
"teenager, sneaking out, caught, want to stop, don't know where to start, how do I stop",Ive talked to many teens who frequently sneak out The question I always ask them is What are you getting from sneaking out that you arent getting at home Many teens answer they are hooking up using substances and engaging in other risky behaviors As uncomfortable as it might be I encourage you to talk with your parents or guardians about the reasons why you are sneaking out What are you getting out there that you arent getting at home A good family counselor can help sort through those issues Good luck
"suffer from, checking OCD, cleaning OCD, counseling, get over",Counseling can be very effective for OCD In particularly a kind of therapy called Exposure Response Ritual Prevention Therapy is considered the gold standard for the treatment of OCD What this is is a specific protocol that helps you build relaxation strategies and to increase the amount of time between your checkingcleaning rituals while also helping you to face any of the fears that OCD given you until those rituals and fears are no longer interfering with your life Research has shown that this kind of therapy may even be more effective for OCD than medication httpsajppsychiatryonlineorgdoifull101176appiajp1621151
"intense mood swings, high mood, irritated by other people, blame other people, tendencies, not working out",Mood swings and getting frustrated when things dont work out is totally normal Sometimes we get tied to one thing we really want to do and it can feel pretty intense when that gets interrupted or doesnt work out This said youre coming to CounselChat and so Im guessing this is something that is pretty intense for you and something that you are concerned about If this is getting in the way of your life it may be worthwhile to reach out to a therapist or doctor to get some help with this and see if there might be something more going on While for most people frustrationmood swings is related to typical life and stress if very intense it can be a sign of a number of challenges ranging from anxiety to a traumatic experience to something like Bipolar Disorder where a persons mood and energy might fly so high mania that one feels like they can do anything but often become frustrated when interrupted note there is a lot more to Bipolar Disorder than this and this is certainly not a diagnosis Wish you well
"nightmares, hearing voices, horrible things, care about",Hearing voices can be a very upsetting experience to have I want you to know that a lot of people will hear a voice at some point in their lives and that there are many things that cause voices Oftentimes significant stress can offset us to have symptoms like this There also mental and physical health conditions that can do the same I strongly encourage you to seek out help from both a doctor and a counselor to help you piece together exactly what is causing your voices I Once youve got that down youll know what to work on In the meantime here are some strategies to cope with voices1 Lower your stress levels Oftentimes stress makes voices worse What can you do to lower your stress2 Get enough Sleep Like stress sleep deprivation is an awful trigger for hearing voices3 Listen to Music Music can help you focus on another sound4 Wear headphone or Earplugs5 Use Your Own Voice If the voices are saying harsh things to you it can be tempting to talk back and thats okay if you do However you cn also use your own voice through singing whistling or the like which can help drown out the voices6 Remind Yourself that What the Voices Say is Not True Sometimes it Helps to Write it Out7 Draw the Voice or Give it a Name This can make it less scary and help get it outside of you8 Keep Track of When You Hear Voices to Identify Triggers These are situations you can avoid while these are so distressful for you9 Be Kind to Yourself When a Voice is Being Cruel to You it is especially important to be kind to yourself10 Remember that while hearing voices can be disturbing that it is a common experience and something that many people recover from
"danger, neglected, episode, diagnosed, bipolar type 1",I do not think there is such a thing as a psychotic seizure however there is something called a pseduoseizure or psychogenic nonepileptic seizure Basically this is when a person shows signs of a fullon seizure such as falling and convulsing but they are not producing brain waves consistent with a seizure Psedoseizures tend to be brought on by high stress emotional challenges and trauma history You can learn more here httpswwwncbinlmnihgovbooksNBK441871 Still the best way to now what your doctor meant would be to ask them
"scary thoughts, scare myself, bad is going to happen, cant get it out, stop these thoughts",Scary thoughts can feel overwhelming at times as well as feeling quite real I want to acknowledge how scary they can feel but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts The first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them I also realize that might seem really hard to do but heres a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work Thoughts arise in the mind all the time our brain is a thought machine Many thoughts drift by like clouds and we dont pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way ie scary angry happy sad and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particulate thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety So how do we work or stop those scary thought streams One new skill to implement comes from the work of Rick Hansen he wrote the book Buddhas Brain he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts Hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way the brain is like Velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts There are reasons that our brain works this way but I dont have time to go into all of that in this response So its just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories  this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time If a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought
"imaginary friend, cope with stressful situations, worried, upset, advice, comforts, be okay, name Solace, comforting motherly figure, own advice, own thoughts, voice other than my own, never really listen, separate personality, develop, mentality, own person",Hi Im Amelia You know it does sounds like you have imagined a motherly comfort figure for yourself Sometimes when I have a person in my office that is very selfcritical I have himher speak to his or herself as though heshe were speaking to a loved one Isnt it sad that we speak to others more lovingly than we do ourselvesIf you have not received empathy nurturing or comfort from a caregiver it is hard to internalize empathy nurture or comfort from the inside There is a saying that We have been hurt in relationships and we can heal in relationships Healing and growth are best provided in the context of healthy relationship How about going the next step and finding a compassionate therapist or loving mentor that could actually provide you with the comfort that you need You deserve to be seen heard noticed and valued I am wishing my very best to you
"ignore them, come to a conclusion, wrong, correct",It is not correct because someone who is narcissistic believes they are always rightIf you ignore the person then their thinking is that there is something wrong with youIgnoring the person to the degree this is possible in the situation or relationship will spare you to be misunderstood further
"judge others, rudely",I agree with you and this is emotionally painful to watch or be on the receiving sideDepending on who is the person doing this and your relationship to them it is possible to kindly point out that the person may unnecessarily hurt someones feelingsIf you express your thoughts and give your guidance then whatever the person does afterwards you have the peace of knowing you tried to redirect this behavior
"intense attraction, unexpected, ballet uniform, television show, cant get her out of my mind",Why not make good use of your unexpected attraction to study the features you consider attractive in someoneAttraction based on physicality is normal  As long as you have no negative thoughts of doing harm to the person or yourself which are connected to the attraction you feel and so long as your attraction isnt stopping you from doing your daily life responsibilities such as work to take care of your daily needs and any responsibilities you have for other people then eventually it will lose its power on you
"possessive, hurting friendships, fix underlying issues",Hi there Its great you are able to realize there are other issues going on with someone who feels possessive At the root of it is fear Fear of losing someone fear of being alone fear of not being good enough All those fears can lead to low selfesteem and feeling like you have to control other people so you dont lose them The thing is controlling other people only pushes them away Vicious circle right What I would suggest is some cognitive therapy to change those underlying ways of thinking You can start with this assignment Write down all the things you think about yourself positive and notsopositive Then rewrite those notsopositive things so they are positive For example thinking something like Im too pushy can be rewritten as Im assertive and I go after what I want It can be hard to do since we tend to get stuck in our negative ways of thinking about ourselves If you have someone you trust you can ask for their help as well since most likely they see you differently than you see yourselfFinding a good cognitive therapist can help you further but if thats not an option for you right now there are lots of selfhelp books and websites that are out there Youve already taken the first step so keep moving forward
"ruining my life, decisions, serious changes, force myself to change",Hello and thank you for your question Changing unwanted behavior is one of the hardest things a person can do I agree with Sherry that being patient with yourself is important Here are a few things I would suggest1 Get clear on the behaviors you really want to change and make sure they are behaviors that CAN be changed Sometimes we will set a goal like I want to be more confident but that is hard to measure and prove to yourself that you accomplished it Saying you are going to accept a date or go on a job interview is something you can actually do and something that you may consider to be demonstrating confidence Whatever your change of behavior is make sure it is something you can actually change 2 If you are going to give up a behavior decide what you are going to do in place of it So if you are going to stop showing up late for work then you are deciding to be on time for work and demonstrating your value of being punctual 3 If you are going to make changes really nail down WHY you want to make them What is it about making these changes that is important to you as a person For example if you have the goal of weight loss the reason this is important to you as a person may be because you value selfcare Knowing WHY you want to make changes is both your motivation and your compass for getting there 4 Once you know WHY you want to make these changes I strongly suggest setting small goals If you set too high of goals you may not accomplish them and just feel worse So make the goal small realistic and guided by the the things you want to be as a person 5 As Sherry mentioned finding a counselor is sometimes a good idea if you really feel stuck Any counselor who does work with goalsetting and motivation can probably help Be wellRobin Landwehr DBH LPCC
"feel like myself, walk up an entire flight of stairs, legs are moving, watching my life be lived by someone else",You may be experiencing a form of dissociation called depersonalization  People with this type of dissociation may feel disconnected from their bodies feel that they are watching their bodies from a distance or may not recognize their image in the mirror  Dissociation sometimes occurs after someone experiences something traumatic  I would suggest working with a therapist who specializes in dissociative disorders as dissociation does not typically resolve on its own  On my website I have some information specific to dissociation that you may find helpful  Best of luck to you
"upset, panicked, shocked, mad, wrong with me",The good news is your awareness that being violent to animals feels out of character for you   Im glad you have awareness and Im glad you are not at ease with killing frogsFairly likely that you were acting out aggressively toward the frog feelings of being on the receiving side of similar type of violenceBasically you did unto the frog what someone has or to you feels like has been done to youUse your surprising finding of how strong your anger and most likely inward pain   Reflect on your closest relationships and how these people treat you   It is possible you feel more hurt by someone who is close to you than you ever realizedStabbing innocent frogs is wrong  It is understandable as a way to show you how much inner pain you probably haveIt is also wrong that someone close to you hurt youThe direction to go is to recognize your pain and then decide how to go about changing what is possible on your side of that or those relationships
"innocent, hurt, kill, sad, love, helpless, tempted, shame, guilt",A lot of different things could be happening here Do you feel angry or sad or anxious when you think about how helpless he is If you have not actually kicked him then I would encourage you to look at feelings other than guilt since you did not hurt him What else is thereIt would probably be very helpful to talk with a therapist about the specifics of this so that you can see what else is happening for you It could be that you feel safe with your cat so strong emotions come up because you feel safe
"diagnosed type one diabetic, tough time dealing, attachment issue, angry, demands, mother moved, nicer home, driving us crazy",There are many possible answers here It could be that she misses friends that she felt safe in the other house emotionally safe and comfortable or dozens of other things Will she talk about it when shes not mad You mentioned that she has an attachment issue It could also be that she was attached to the house Its not the same as being attached to a person but possessions and safe places certainly mean a lot
"freaked out, escalated, kicking me out, unspeakable things, calling the cops, unable to stop",Bipolar disorder has a lot of different components If this is a onetime event it could be that your daughter had an intense moment of anger and the phrase of asking her to calm down may have made her feel as though you werent understanding what she was saying Bipolar disorder also includes feelings of depression When this is coupled with intense anger and acting or speaking without thinking these can be part of bipolar disorder but that wouldnt be the whole picture of what bipolar disorder would look like It may be helpful to track differences that you notice in your daughters mood and any patterns related to the times of day or what seems to lead her to be upset Patterns are very helpful in figuring out what is happening
"working out, eating fruits and vegetables, junk in the house",I know some people do better when they dont have as much junk food in the house This is not as tempting then Having said that maybe you can reward yourself with different things such as having dessert on certain days If you are concerned about mostly eating habits consider seeing a nutritionist They can help you find the balance between what it is that you really want and your goals Im not sure how this links to happiness for you but hopefully looking at your choices can lead you toward your goal of being healthier
"emotions, felt, better, started, back of my mind",Best answer that I can give to you is that some level of depersonalization is quite normal for everyone it will come and go throughout life kind of like being on a rollercoaster here it is then its gone not to return for quite some time like many things the more that you fixate on it the more stress it will cause you consider it part of life accept it and move on now if your having many many many of these episodes or have some auditory or visual hallucination or disturbances or emotional unbalancing that accompany it than that is definitely something to look at but for the most part nothing to worry about Hope this helpsC
"feeling sad, cry, feel better, upset with people, hurt their feelings, rollercoaster, hard",Hello and thank you for your question Bipolar disorder is generally characterized by extreme changes in mood ranging from mania highs to depression lows There are different types however so here is a website that gives you a list of symptoms for mania and depression in bipolar disorder httpwwwwebmdcomdepressionguidebipolardisordermanicdepressionpage2After reviewing these symptoms if you believe you may have bipolar disorder then you may want to see your primary care provider or a counselor Bipolar disorder is treatable but for many people it requires the right medication and sometimes counseling to help people make behavior changes that are important for bipolar management For example some people may not get regular sleep but proper rest is important for bipolar management A counselor may talk to you about this and other lifestyle changes that you may need to make The good news is that many people live happy healthy and productive lives with bipolar disorder So if it turns out that you do have bipolar disorder it doesnt mean that things cant get better There is currently no cure for bipolar disorder but with proper medication and lifestyle management people can do quite wellHope this was helpful Be wellRobin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC
"crazy, emotions, symptoms, situations",Do an internet research on psychosis symptoms and see if you have several of the symptoms  If you do seek a medical evaluation from your primary care physician  There are great medications and psychotherapy that can help you live your life to the fullest  There a many people who are diagnosed with psychosis and living a productive life
"emotions, cry, fear, sarcastic, moody, clingy, on edge, awful, leaving, public places, pull at my hair, plug my ears, hit myself, throw things",There is a reason you are having breakdowns I cant agree that they happen for no reason at all   Finding out the reason is going to be your biggest challenge because that may require you to dig deep into your past uncover hurtful experiences or recognize something that would be extremely pain  However if you dont find professional help to carefully guide you through whatever you may confront the symptoms mentioned will continue and may even get worse  There is a light at the end of the road but you need some help to find the right road to get on so you can see it
"exboyfriend, lies, lazy, builds trust, borrowing money, friends in debt, sob story, refuses to work, playing games, drug habit, debt with bills, compulsively lying, spending money, good person, homeless person, epilepsy, antisocial, socialize, movies, video games, drives me, small things, pathological liar, deep down",It sounds like you have some ambivalent feelings towards your exboyfriend that are difficult to sort out You notice that there are both desirable and undesirable things about him and this is true of everyone to one degree or another One question that I would have for you is are you satisfied with your relationship with him as it currently stands Are you happy with the boundaries between the two of you or would you like them to be different Negotiating through conflict and establishing different boundaries are definitely things you could work on with the help of a therapist Another question I would have for you is what would it mean for you to find out what motivates his behavior Discovering the roots of such behavior is something that he would have to work on in his own therapy and not something that you and a therapist could discover without him
"death, thinking, suicidal, sad, future, driving, imagining",Ill respond to your speculation that if you let go of the steering wheel while driving youll end up quite seriously hurt at the very least   It is fine to play in your mind with what ifs   People who write horror movie scripts most likely have some terrible sounding stories and suppositionsIf you trust yourself to actually not follow through with an idea that may kill you and you recognize the difference between thinking dangerous things and doing dangerous things then go to the next step of understanding more about your thoughts on deathSince you wonder about being missed if you die it is possible your thoughts about death are from feeling that you are metaphysically dead to people in your life whom you wish would show more interest in youPlay around with your idea as to why youd consider how people will feel about you if youre not in their livesThis may offer some insight as to your expectations of current relationships with others
"emotional, no reason, high school, first year, recently",Hello Vancouver Its really common for people to become very upset over small things sometimes The small thing is a trigger and the emotions arent so much about that event thats happening in the present they are more connected to old events that evoked the same feeling Youve likely had too much of that feeling in your life and youve developed a sensitivity to it Look at the small events that are triggers for you and ask yourself what same or similar emotion they evoke If theres anger there look underneath that Is it powerlessness worthlessness hurt shame  Then ask yourself when in your life youve experienced TOO much of that feeling As a child maybe but not necessarily Thats the first step and combined with empathy compassion and selfesteem youre starting to build what I call an emotional air conditioner A good therapist can help you with the rest of this process and with learning ways of coping with emotions daily I wish you the best
"lazy, aware of the problem, shake the habits, creating excuses, procrastination, regrets, low grade, all-time low, straight-A student, Cs and Fs, hurts, work is hard",Possibly laziness is not the true problem and is only what appears as the problemSince you describe your laziness as an observable quality I assume youve not always felt or handled yourself this wayQuite possibly and more likely the particular conditions of your current life are not ones that are optimal for feeling good about yourself and your involvementsOne suggestion is to see if there is any purpose to what youre doing in all the areas in which you see yourself acting from lazinessIf youre not able to notice any good purpose then you may be mistaking laziness for a significant amount of stress in your lifeStress can be opened and understood  If stress is what underlies what appears as laziness then you define the contributors to your stressNot feeling enough support in your life financial uncertainty arguments w people who are close in your life feeling misunderstood overall or by particular people all are possibilitiesGood luck in learning more about who you are
"infections, scars, bother, filled up with blood, concerned",Hi Houston The fact that youre concerned says a lot If I was your therapist Id ask you questions about your worries and how this is causing a problem in your life Youre causing perhaps permanent changes damage to your body and its likely youre trying to express somethingpain maybe A therapist can help you to explore whats going on for you and how to get your needs for selfexpression met in a more healthy way Good luck
"struggling, undiagnosed bipolar disorder, making my daytoday life extremely difficult",It sounds like you are experiencing a great deal of distress and youre wondering if it may meet a diagnosis of Bipolar disorder There are a few different types of Bipolar diagnoses in the DSM diagnositc and statistical manual and the best way to find out if your experiences would meet that diagnosis would be to meet with a mental health professional You can also look up the diagnosis online and see if what you are going through meets the criteriaOne question that I would have for you is what would it mean for you to find out that you meet the criteria for such a diagnosis It sounds like whether or not you do you are suffering and working with a therapist may help you get into a better place
"phone addiction, time passing quickly, playing games, trying to make phone fun, feeling like time wasted, improving phone performance",Start by spending small amounts of time with your own thoughts and feelingsAlways being focused on what a phone offers keeps people at a distance from knowing themselvesAs long as you make time to spend in an activity which is not interactive the way a phone is and instead depends only upon your actions you will be investing time and energy into your own lifeWhether by consciously considering your own interests or doing housecleaning or chores by devoting yourself to areas which you decide to be involved in you will increase your knowledge of your own interestsThen to not be so involved with your phone will be natural and easy
"recovery, not okay, policy, peer, counselor, small community, sober, treatment, mental health, life skill groups, substance peers",You definitely want to make sure not to inadvertently create an inappropriate dual relationship with a client In fact it is not uncommon for state regulatory boards to determine that a clinician and client being in the same 12 step group is professional misconduct You might want to consider attending a 12 step meeting that is located in a different community than the one you work in  Another option would be to look for oneonone or small group recovery support
"drug rehabilitation program, kicked out, using drugs again, overdosed, found dead, counselors, therapists, halfway house, accountability, relapsed, legal case, failing to report",Im so sorry to hear of your loss  This sounds like a really difficult situation for the whole family  Since the answer to this question will depend a lot on the applicable state laws I would suggest talking with a local attorney  That being said I see two competing issues here  On the one side is the duty of confidentiality the counselors owed to your relative  On the other side is the duty the counselors had to act reasonably to protect your relative from harm  Generally there is not a requiremt for substance abuse treatment centers to notify family members if an adult client relapsesA local attorney will be able to provide more specific guidance on the legal obligtions and liabilities in this situation
"therapist, parent, drugs, child, lies, custody visitation",This sounds like a potentially serious situation The most important thing is to make sure the child is safe  If you suspect that a child is or has been harmed I would strongly recommend that you report your concerns to your local law enforcement or to Child Protective Services If you dont think that a child is in danger you can still report your suspicion of counselor misconduct to the state regulatory board
"treatment discontinued, no apparent reason, diagnose schizophrenia",The general rule against medical abandonment says thst whenever healthcare providers discontinue treatment with you when you still need it they are legally required to make sure that you have access to another provider of equal or higher abilityIn this case if your treatment team decided to discontinue your treatment based on a diagnosis of schizophrenia they still will likely be required to provide you with a referral to someone who can provide you with treatment If you havent already done so Id recommend that you explicitly ask for a referral
"dispute, therapist, appointment cancellation, blocking, psychologists, clinic, insurance, psychiatric services, 48 hour cancellation policy, appointments, late, out of town, phone in session, double sessions",My recommendation would be to try to talk to your therapist about this  from your description it sounds like you have a legitimate explanation for missing your scheduled session Maybe if you could explain that to her she would be willing to work with you If she is not willing to consider your explanation and if she is not willing to continue working with you she still has an ethical obligation to provide you with referral resources to another therapist
"terminated counseling relationship, realizing, begin counseling again, voicemail message, returns calls in 24 hours, called on the weekend, want him to call me back, ignore me",Mental health providers should promptly return calls from current clients as well as from potential clients  This is even true if the social worker or counselor is unable to make an appointment with the caller  In that case the social worker should call you back to let you know that he is unable to schedule an appointment with youIn addition mental health providers have an obligation to follow through with their own communication standards  For example if the social worker in this case has an outgoing voicemail message that promises returned calls within 24 hours he has an obligation to follow through on that promiseAll that being said it is also worth remembering that mental health professionals are just people too It is possible that he had an unforeseen emergency that kept him from from returning your call promptlyIn the end I agree with Sherrys advice If you feel this social worker is not a good fit for you you probably should trust your gut and find someone else who is a better fit
"depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, anger issues, therapist, cant afford",It can be difficult to get counseling if you dont feel supported by family members  There might be a few options  If you are in school Id recommend talking to a school counselor or school nurse  They often will be able to help you access free or affordable counseling resources in your community  In addition depending on where you live its also often possible to call 211 for referrals to free or low cost counseling services in your areaId encourage you not to give up You are on the right track
"major depression, severe PTSD, anxiety disorder, personality disorder, upset, shared with doctor, particular drug",Your doctor might be required to tell your psychiatrist  especially if your doctor is concerned about your safetyIt was definitely a good thing that you told your primary care physician about what is going on  I know that must have been difficult to talk about with him  By having that conversation you are helping your primary care physician and your psychiatrist work together to best support your health
"counselor decide, end counseling sessions, terminate working, client",There are typically three reasons why therapy is terminated1 Client has met therapy goals2 Client is not progressing 3 Therapist is not a good fit for clientIn order to properly assess whether therapy is helping and what progress is being made the therapist needs to have ways of consistently checking in with clients sessionsbysession to determine what is helping what isnt and where the client is at in relation to their original therapy goals When a client has met their goals that is a good time to end counselling sessions unless the client has new goals or simply wants to checkin periodically to make sure that they are still on track sometimes referred to as relapse prevention When a client is not progressing and feedback has been taken and attempts have been made to make the therapy more helpful for the client but to no avail than it is considered unethical to continue to work with the client In these circumstances referring out to another therapist who may be a better fit is a good idea
"emotional distress, trust issues, betrayal, financial strain, medical emergency, heavily medicated, credit card information, therapist dropped off",Im sorry to hear that this has happened Counselors are legally and ethically required to make sure that they always put the wellbeing of their clients above their own interests In addition counselor ethical rules and the laws in just about every state make it illegal for counselors to take advantage of a client financially A counselor borrowing money from a client even if the counselor pays it back would usually be considered to be taking advantage of the clientThere are a few options you have at this point if you cant or dont want to continue to try to contact him directly You can file a complaint with your states regulatory board and let them know what has happened  An investigator will then look into the situation for you  Another option would be for you to find a different counsleor who can provide you with an independent and netural point of view to help you figure out how you want to handle this situation
"college experience, courses taken, enjoy job, in school",Its a great idea for you to reach out to find a psychologist to talk to if this is a field you might be interested in pursuing Regarding the length of schooling it generally takes 4 years of college and an additional 4 to 7 years of graduate school to earn a doctorate degree to become a psychologist There are also other similar professions including counseling that dont require a doctorate degree Licensed counselors generally completed 4 years of college and an additional 2 years of graduate school If you are thinking about a career in psychology the local APA chapter would be a good place to start to find a local psychologist to talk to Heres a link to the NJ APA chapterhttpswwwpsychologynjorg
"cultural shock, depressed, counselor, savior, vacation, special gift, wine, appropriate, Christmas",This is a great question In general it is not appropriate for counselors to accept gifts from their clients There are some exceptions to this general rule  including a recognition that there may be a valid cultural aspect to this type of gift givingIt might be best to simply offer your counselor a holiday card as an expression of your feelings You could also talk to your counselor about the gift and ask if him it if would be appropriateIn the end I know he would most appreciate just knowing how much the counseling meant to you
"eating disorder, binging, gastric sleeve surgery, abuse as a child, addiction, abusive men, therapy, no feedback, five months",It can be really frustrating to feel like your counselor is not providing you with the help you needMy recommendation in a situation like this would be to let your counselor know how you feel Specifically tell Your counselor that you dont seem to be getting the amount of feedback you would likeIf this doesnt help then you might want to look for another counselor who will be a better fit for you
"worried, past events, current mental status, unsure, ask my doctor, seeing someone",Having this kind of conversation with a doctor can feel difficult But remember you are the expert on you Any good medical professional will recognize thatYou are absolutely right to think about the importance of being your own health care advocate Generally the best approach is simply to be honest Let your doctor know what you are concerned about and tell your doctor what you think might help If there is a specific issue that youd like to address in counseling let you doctor know about it And dont hesitate to directly ask for a referralI know this may all feel a little overwhelming It might help to bring a family member or significantother with you to provide support when you talk to your doctor Its great that youve already taken this first step to reach out Youre on the right track
"stress, dealing with stress, handle, feel less stressed out",In case you feel some relief to know youre feeling the tone of our timesWe live with crumbling of our values which then gives rise to insecurity everywhere  If someone doesnt know what their values are then its difficult to do anything and right now everyday we hear uncertainty in what used to be our basic assumptionsYoure more normal for noticing and feeling stressed than if you imagine life felt fine the way it isOne road to take is to accept that there are no clear roads forward  This means to change long term goals into shorter onesAlso in general the more focused you can be as to your particular wishes motivations interests and people about whom you care the greater will be your sense of confidence that your personal world is as secure as it can be for right nowAnd it helps too to know that nothing lasts forever eventually all of what is up in the air will start to land in a much more clear way
"stress, deal with, help, knowing, what can I do",Something different works for each of usThere are the outward answers of selfpampering and making your home and work environment as pleasant as possibleA deeper level way to decrease stress is through exercise or alternative practices like yoga or tai chiIf the stress is more deeply rooted than temporarily feeling irritated for a few days then give yourself some time to reflect and clarify what the meaning of the stress is to youSelfunderstanding and appreciating your efforts to know yourself may decrease stress because youll be more focused and attentive to who you are  This will influence you overall to make good decisions for yourself and these will naturally be ones which decrease stress as much as possible
"stress, worry, overthink, money, late 20s, two jobs, school, under my belt",A good start is to pay attention to some basic issues sleep nutrition exercise and socially supportive relationships A great car on an empty tank will not get you very far
"fetish, normal",Maybe it is a way to secretly satisfy your own wish to be or to live life gay
"sexually assaulted, older man, guilt, shame, attracted, younger men",Sometimes the reason for being attracted to older men is because of growing up with a father who was distantIf you grew up having enough interaction with your dad to know youd have liked more and didnt receive this then maybe your longings of childhood are still active within youIt is ok to like older menJust be sure youre not idealizing them or anyone elseBecause regardless of age a relationship is based on who the two people really are not how wed like imagining them
"sexual tension, imagining having sex, lonely, empty, missing something, fantasize, interfering with study, thinking about sex",Hi Montreal Im glad you wrote What youre experiencing is normal Were sexual beings We have a builtin desire to connect sexually with others because it feels good to keep procreation going and mostly to connect with other people because connecting with others makes us feel fulfilled and valuable Sexual desire is a healthy part of you Maybe your body is telling you it wants to dive into that water and taste it instead of just staring at it It sounds like youre beginning to explore yourself sexually and thats okayAt your young age you also have another innate burning desire and that is to know yourself I see both of these desires burning and competing in you Its a bit of a crazy timeyou want to connect with others but youre not sure who you are or what you want from them You want to know yourself but you cant learn about yourself in a vacuum Its okay to trust your instincts Its okay to connect sexually with others as long as youre preventing disease and pregnancy and you know how to protect your boundaries But even as I write this I think maybe Im being controlling and overprotective of you its your body and youre in charge of what happens to it But I do want you to be safewhatever that means to you Maybe talk to someone you trust With each encounter you have with other people sexual or not you will learn more about yourself and what you want both sexually and just in relationship or friendship You will develop a sense of who you areHave you tried to get to know yourself sexually This is a super place to start and knowing how your own body works can give you confidence when you eventually connect with others When you explore your own body what feels good What brings you to orgasm I wish you well as you explore both who you are and how it feels to connect with others safely
"high school, friend, masturbate, hate, weird, messed up, escalated, gay thing, pushed away, trouble, recently came up, head",Writing about your high school masturbation times with your friend is itself a form of acknowledging the full picture of who you are   You are doing well to reflect on your actions in the truthful way you are doingAlso positive is that you have perspective that at your age and social maturity you were innocently doing something that in adult terms would be considered in a negative wayMaybe through your more mature minds eye of today you can feel some compassion and understanding for your high school self  This way your sense of selfjudgment may start to dissolve a little bit more
"jokes, made, everything, need to say something, funny, awkward",I agree it is awkward when people make jokes about subjects which may not be funny at all  And if a person only jokes then after laughing and realizing the person has nothing of themselves to offer this can also be quite tediousRealize that you are more aware of human interaction having many levels of expression  You could start avoiding people who irritate you by the way they behave
"pranking, likes him, forced, ruined friendship, wont forgive, guilty, crying",In order for your friend to forgive you shed need to trust you understand the damage you introduced into her relationship with her friendIts possible if you offer your friend expressions of your empathy toward her  over an extended time possibly shell forgive youYoure certainly learning relationship lessons on how to treat people and the effect of betraying another person which will last foreverMaybe this was meant to be the outcome
"mentored, spiritually, weird, manipulation, lying, blamed, troubles, worried, trusted position, leadership, attacking, character",You may intuitively be sensing what many professionals in the social sciences and psychology have already understoodJust Google psychopaths and leadership and many articles come up about boardroom politics and that psychopaths are very successful in these rolesTheoretically is it terrible that corporate leadership qualities match those of psychopaths  Well yes  And I consider your question as a mark of your sensitive awareness toward other people  Being able to recognize social dynamics is a strength that you havePsychopaths know how to be charming and to twist words so that others believe that their own interest is the same as the psychopathsI agree with you about not being able to change peoples minds who are attached to this persons interactionsThe only way you can introduce a change in the relationship system of a psychopath is that if you are aware of illegal or law breaking activity and you have evidence of this that you contact relevant authoritiesNo one is allowed to break laws including psychopaths
"emotions, symptoms, situations, message sending, reading messages, not answering messages, feeling ignored, insecurity, seeking validation, lack of understanding, desire for response",I understand the feeling of not being liked due to not having any responses on the sites you listMore than likely the nonresponse has less to do with liking you than w liking the way you write your messagesHave you tried asking a question in your posts  This would be one way to invite people to answer your postWhen you write  imagine yourself as the reader of the postIf you think about the wording of a question which would motivate you to respond then this formula will very likely be the same for many others who read your postGood luck
"bullying, much worse, going on, vague comments, confront, messages, get in my head, fight back, ruin me",Sorry to hear of your problem situation  Feeling intimidated by another person is very unsettlingStop having contact with the personBullies only interact with others either by intimidating someone or by themselves feeling intimidated by someoneBullies do not have the same dynamics as everyone elseNo one can convince or persuade or talk a bully out of their behaviorThe best protection for yourself assuming you are not being physically threatened by the person is to close contact with themThis does not take away any of the disappointment or sadness of wishing for a better relationship with the personUntil the bully wants to interact differently with others only harm can result from contact with themStep one is to stop the bleeding then to assess and learn to live with not having the person in your life
"negative feelings, friends, effort, nourishing, relationship",One thing I would ask is why are you still hanging with those friends A relationship needs to be nurtured by both parties it is a dynamic fluctuation between two people I would ask you to question why you continue to remain together as friends I always believed that a relationship should emit positivity towards all parties involved if your in a relationship that is onesided it is inevitable that it will start to decompensate Never travel with the circus never travel with fools everything in life should have some positive payout will things at times be negative of course they will but in order to keep something or someone in your life there should be more positivity than negativityHope this helps C
"problems, shutting out, putting up walls",It sounds like you would like to let other people get close to you and at the same time you are finding yourself compelled to keep people at a distance Often times when we have difficulty trusting others it is because we have specific fears about what would happen if we get close or let our guard down Such fears may be rooted in past experiences in relationships in which we were hurt and or disappointed In working with a therapist you can gain insight into what is underneath your compulsion to put walls around yourself and develop ways to form authentic lasting satisfying relationships with others
"quinceañera, girls, dresses, don't like, week away, don't know, emotions, symptoms, situations",How did you find out that the girls arent happy with their dressesDid you hear this directly from one of them or is this third hand information that someone else told you about one of the girls in your partyThe answer matters because gossiping instead of directly telling you about a problem is a problem in itselfI suggest a conversation with the entire group of girls in which you tell them how you actually are feeling about their opinions about the dressesOne topic you may consider bringing up is what everyone expects to get out of the party  Are they coming because they like one another and wearing a dress in which the girl is happy is only one way of having fun togetherYou may learn a great deal as to the difference in values about a quinceaña among you and your friendsI hope youll have a fun party
"positive relationships, present","Staying present is an attitude most of us aspire
to and most of us have to work at itcertainly at first Im here to tell you
that living in the now or being mindful is a skill anyone can learn Unfortunately
the only way to do it is to do it What a paradox But there are plenty of
other skills that we are not born with walking on stilts riding a bike
swimming and driving a car are good examples You cant learn them by reading about
themHaving said that I can recommend two books on
the subject Eckhart Tolles The Power of
Now and David Richos When the Past
is Present Richo asks that we dont beat ourselves up about dwelling on
past events This is natures way of reminding us that we have unfinished
business But while we are attended to the wounds and confusion that litter our earlier lives we can prepare to inhabit the expanded present that awaits usHe offers three helpful steps to making any important life
changeStep One Hold in awareness the behavior
belief attitude or characteristic you want to change in yourself and how you
want to be different Awareness is the opposite of distraction and stuffingStep Two Live as if you have
already made the change This is hard and takes courage but you can do it
Ride that bikeeven if for a foot or twoStep Three Be persistent
Practice practice practiceJust as twoyearolds are able to walk
confidently after hundreds of hours of practice youll be able to stay in the
here and now as long as you want after trying and failing many many times"
"exaggerating feelings, being attacked, blowing things out of proportion, role of the victim, being unreasonable, annoying friends, being insensitive, not respecting, friendship",Conflict is a tricky beast and shows up in every one of our relationships What Im reading is that you find yourself in a loop of  seeking validation of your thoughts and feelings from your friends rather than validating yourself Am I right If you arent validating yourself no one else will be able to either  Try finding a small nugget of truth in the feedback your friends give you this will help to lower your defenses and help your friends hear what you are really sharing  And then if you are still feeling vulnerable share that too
"calling names, hypocrite, baby, tired, same manner, what should I do",It sounds like your confused as to why your friends would be calling you a hypocrite when they act in the same manner correct Communication is key to any relationship I would recommend speaking with your friends facetoface to address why they feel your behavior is concerning Inperson contact is the best method of sorting out differences considering texts emails or any written response can be misconstrued Be upfront with them and let them know that being accused of hypocrisy is hurtful and you feel it is unfounded If after speaking with them you feel that they have valid reasons for the way they are feeling maybe you can consider modifying your behavior accordingly Especially if this friendship is valuable to you However make sure they are aware that there is a respectful way to address these issues and name calling is not one of them On the other hand if you feel that their reasons are indeed unfounded it may be best to distance yourself from the relationship Not all friendships are healthy ones And it is important that you surround yourself with people who are an asset to your self esteem as opposed to those that hinder itI hope you are able to get this matter sorted Best of luck
"bullied, teachers, depression, sad, deal, school, help",Thats a very difficult situation that you are in But you are not alone I have several schoolaged clients who find little to no assistance from their teachers at their schools regarding bullyingThere are a few options that are available to you to help deal with being bullied at school One option that I would suggest is for you to talk to your support network Friends and family can sometimes be good sources of support Another option would be to speak with us about your counselor if you have one And third there are some excellent online sources of support regarding the bullying at school wwwstopbullyingorg
"upset, refuses, screams, loves, mornings",It doesnt sound like he hates you just misses mom and dad in the mornings You could validate his feelings by saying something like I know you want to see mom and dad right now but they are working and then give him a couple options of things that may take his mind off of it This could be choosing what he has for breakfast or playing a game of his choice If possible it may also be helpful if you could create a routine in which he stops by mom and dad to say good morning If this is routine he will come to understand that he will be able to see mom and dad for a minute and not become anxious about seeing them
"need to get on base, see my doctor, ID card stolen, unable to reach husband, only one who can take me on base, get a new ID, continue to see doctor",You should be able to get a replacement ID card either from the Personnel Office on your local base the actual name of this office will vary depending on which branch of the military it is You may also be required to go to the Military Police or Security office on base to report the loss of your old ID card
"therapists, classify, personality, characteristics, decide, client, point of view",This is a great question and I am happy to have the opportunity to explain my approach When I am determining what type of personality a client has I take my time and really absorb their lens point of view to themselves and others Determining a personality type takes some time getting to know the person and building rapport After taking time to get to know them and learning about their view they have of themselves and others it is important to pickup on more specific personality traits which comprehensively contribute to a personality type Clinicians including myself often witness certain traits that are enduring and consistent which indicate a type of personality For example if a therapist is noticing that a client is exhibiting traits of organization needing to be on time planning and perfectionism these traits contribute to the type A personality In addition to utilizing clinical judgment clinicians often use personality assessments and follow the guidelines of the DSM5 ICD10
"random thoughts, dont want, worth anything, wrong with me, stop having, these thoughts",I think we all go through a period of time where we think we arent worth anything Sometimes these feelings are a result of low self esteem or because of shame The most important part of dealing with this thought is to separate feelings from reality I dont feel worth anything but I know what I do is important I know who I am matters to others I know I am loved and cared aboutWhen you find yourself having these thoughts stop take a few deep breaths and try to reframe what youre thinking
"empathize, physical pain, life difficult, hyper empathy disorder, new disorder, information, going on",Sometimes its helps to have a name for a problem  it can make you feel less alone as in oh theres a name for this and other people have this experience too On the other hand naming the problem can also make it stick around longer as in now I have a special problem that has a special name and thats an important part of who I amBottom line whether its a disorder or not you would like life to be easier and not have to be pulled so much by other peoples energy and feelings You might want to try imagining that you have a volume dial on your empathy just like the volume dial or button on the tv that you can gently turn down to the point where you still feel whats going on but its not so loud You can also try imagining pulling your own energy back as if you were drawing your energy back home to the center of your own body and being letting go of the other people or characters that pulled your energy out so far This is a way create better boundaries and protect your own vulnerability Just like on an airplane where they tell you to put on your own oxygen mask first before helping anyone else your empathy will most likely not really help others if you allow yourself to be depleted
"right therapist, train my therapist, give me what I need, treatment",Finding the right therapist for you is very important and can sometimes be tricky It can sometimes take a number of sessions to get a good sense of whether you and your therapist are the right fit  The first couple of sessions are generally spent on gathering information formulating a plan of treatment and building the clienttherapist relationship The clienttherapist relationship will be very different from other relationships you have experienced  You will know you have found the right therapist when you notice there is a good rapport between the two of you  You will get a sense that the therapist gets you and understands the issues being presented If you feel that you can trust your therapist and feel comfortable opening up and providing feedback during your sessions then you know it is a good fit In terms of how to train your therapist how to give you what you need from treatment the therapeutic relationship is collaborative so the two of you will be working together as a team During your sessions the goal is for you to feel comfortable giving feedback about what is working and what is not working in your sessions When you express your needs to your therapist then the two of you will discuss the best ways to get those needs met in order to maximize the effectiveness of your sessions
"cry during therapy, normal, emotions",Its more than just normal its expected Quite honestly there are a very few days where at least one client hasnt cried during therapy throughout the day IJP
"basic skills, good counselor, needs",1 An awareness of their own incompetence and inexperience with events in your life2 An awareness of how the body mind emotions spirit and others all intertwine and activate one another3 How to work to use these connections to have you improve your experienceOh yeah and theres some listening in there as well
"difficulties, counselor, encounter, dealing, client",Dang right  Heh heh and correct me if Im wrong and if we are truly professionals we should be able to handle even the most bumptious of folks now shouldnt we Its like a mechanic who knows his way around every inch of an engine hell know what to do heh heh heh
"counseling, help, people",Yes Counseling provides an area for people to speak to an unbiased professional about their concerns to address their unique needs While length of time varies counseling is a process and can be done from as little as one session to multiple sessions Counseling provide a safe nonjudgmental empathetic atmosphere from a professional helper provide the service
"counseling process, start, person",Hello There are many ways to approach a counselor and starting the process however they all start with picking up the phone  Its most definitely an uncomfortable feeling but once that first step is taken it is often met with a wave of relief My recommendation is always to call and speak with a therapist over the phone before scheduling an appointment Listening to how they converse use their tone and inflection may give you a brief insight to how they will respond to you and increase your comfort right away You may also discover rather quickly that this therapist is not the right match for youRegardless of how you go about it I like to remind all people who call email text or walkin therapists are a bit like pizzas  if you dont like the toppings send it back There are hundreds of therapists offering all kinds of styles of therapy  take the time to pick one that suits you
"meeting the client, counselor facilitates, process",For me I want a client to feel like I understand what brings them to seek help from me So I might explore both their present circumstances as well as their history and try to start making some connections between the two but so that the both of us can understand what is taking place Not every therapist goes into history in the same way either The way the therapist practices will often inform the ways in which they collect and look at dataHowever above all my goal especially in the beginning of therapy is to work on developing a working rapport with any client Most research states that the quality of the relationship rather than modality of therapy indicates success rates One of the most essential components of rapport is that someone feels heard attuned to and understood
"tense disagreements, minor differences, overbearing, lazy, intensified, talked back, magnified, major disagreements",What you are describing is something psychologists have termed triangulation which is what happens when one family member will not talk to the one they have a problem with and goes to a third member of the family to complain instead You have been triangulated by your wife and motherThis is often seen in families Its seen everywhere How many times have you had a problem with someone but you didnt go to them to tell them you went to someone else to complain It is usually difficult for a person to confront another especially in relationships where there is a power differential For example I bet its easier to complain to a coworker about your boss rather than go to the boss with your complaintIm not saying triangulation is always a bad thing Sometimes a third party mediator is needed to help solve problems between two people who disagree Thats what therapists do every day Sometimes just getting someone elses perspective can help you see the issue clearer However in your situation it sounds like this is becoming a problem You are stuck in the middle between two people that love you and that you loveIf you want to put a stop to this triangulation you will need to encourage the two of them to talk to each other and work out their differences Perhaps it was a simple misunderstanding that some open communication can clear up Even if they really dont like each other and cant get along your relationship with the both of them is going to continue to deteriorate the longer you are stuck in the middle Try to understand what might be the feelings behind their behavior It is possible that they may both feel threatened by the other These are the two most important women in your life and they both know it Your mother may be afraid that she will lose you if she confronts your wife I heard one motherinlaw describe her sons wife as the gateway to her son The wife has the power to dictate when and how often the mother gets to see her son The wife also is the gateway to the grandchildren If your wife doesnt like her motherinlaw she can severely hamper or damage her motherinlaws relationship with you and any children you two may have From your wifes viewpoint this is the woman that she may feel like she can never live up to If you regularly praise your moms cooking her housework gardening or anything else your wife may feel that you are putting down her own efforts in these areas and can feel unappreciated This can be especially difficult if your wife and mother are nothing alike I am not saying that this is the case with your familys situation These are just a few examples from other families in a similar situation as yours Regardless of what the cause is if this dysfunctional pattern is allowed to continue your mom and your wife will begin to get upset with you when you dont agree with them They will get upset if you dont align yourself with them against the other They will be offended when it seems like you are choosing the other ones side or that you are not standing up for them like they think you should In worst cases if it continues to escalate you may even find yourself in the impossible position of having to choose between your wife and your mother which may mean cutting off contact with the other ending that relationship Change the dynamics before it spirals even further
"planning to have baby, quit smoking, hard, mental need, thinking about smoking, addiction",Hi Good for you in planning ahead to do whats healthiest for your baby and yourself Thats a great first step Its also good that you are able to identify that its not always a physical need thats driving the addictionFor the next steps I would suggest trying to figure out when the psychological cravings for a cigarette occur The psychological or mental cravings are usually based out of habit such as having a cigarette after a meal And if youre consciously trying to quit youll find the craving starts with simply thinking about having a cigarette then usually moves on to thinking about how good it made you feel etc etc Well if Im on a diet and I continue to let myself think about the ice cream sitting in the freezer eventually Ill give in and eat itYoure going to have thoughts about smoking a cigarette Thats normal and for the most part out of your control But you choose whether or not to CONTINUE thinking and dwelling about it after that initial thought Thats what you would have to work on changing When you have that initial thought acknowledge it Ok I kind of want a cigarette now but then change the thoughts that typically follow Distract yourself think about something else do something else whatever it takes to get your mind off of that cigaretteIve suggested to clients before that they should plan these scenarios out ahead of time so they already know what theyre going to do when the time comes Write down when you usually have the craving for a cigarette and then write down new thoughts or things to do to get your mind off of it Eventually it will become easier and easier to brush off that initial thought until you no longer have itBest of luck and you have a really great motivator to quit  your baby
"secrets in my mind, don't know what to do, don't want to tell, don't want to hurt, keep the secret, becoming annoying, making me anxious, help me out",It sounds like keeping the secrets has become a problem for you now There are several things to consider before you make a decision You mentioned that you dont want your wife and mom to know because you dont want to hurt them  why would it hurt them  Is it necessary for them to know this information What are the consequences of either telling them the truth or not telling them for you and for your wife and mom Once you have considered these think of what you would tell your friend if they were in your exact situation Also if your wife or mom were in your situation right now what do you think they would do themselves If your wife and mom were in this situation how would you feel Would you want to know the secrets How has keeping these secrets affected your own mental and physical healthOnce you have looked at the problem from all angles you will be able to better make a decision on whether it is right to tell them or not
"secure relationship, unavailable men, intimacy, relationship, controlling, emotionally abuse, alone, security, survive, behavior, thought process",It is a good thing that you have recognized that you have been in some unhealthy relationships and that you are wanting to break this pattern  You seem to have some good insight into the situationThe type of behavior that you are describing is usually rooted in childhood issues with insecure attachment bonds with your caregivers childhood trauma andor abuse or neglect or dysfunctional family issues that did not allow you to develop healthy boundaries for yourself or a sense of self  This is something that is going to take some time to work through in therapy  I recommend a book titled Boundaries Where you end and I begin by Anne Katherine  Another book that might be helpful is Codependent No More by Melody Beattie In the meantime until you can work through your personal issues absolutely do not enter into another relationship  Take however long you need to and work on becoming a whole happy emotionally healthy person on your own  Needing another person to define you is problematic  Thats too much to expect from any individualFor a relationship to be healthy and happy both people in the relationship first need to be a whole person on their own  That means having a clear sense of self knowing who you are and what you want knowing how to set healthy boundaries and knowing how to meet your own needs  It is unreasonable to expect your partner to meet all of your needs all of the time  There will be times that they wont be able to meet your needs  You have to know how to meet those yourself When you are working on becoming the best you that you can be eventually the right person will come into your life  Then you can CHOOSE to be with someone because you want them in your life instead of feeling like you NEED them to complete you
"fall asleep, nightmares, frightened, unable to breathe, losing sleep, stress, life lost meaning, chronic condition, improve symptoms, running, exercise, release stress, solve issue",First of all exercise is always beneficial for your physical and emotional health Thats great that you have added this in your routine Have you also considered altering your diet Certain foods are linked with poor sleep For example alcohol caffeine nicotine and high fat content foods do not bode well with quality sleep especially right before bed time  On the other hand warm milk and foods high in carbohydrates have actually shown to positively impact sleepAdditionally at bed time its important to keep your room dim cool and without distractions ie TV IPad Phone Stick to a sleep routine and avoid any activities close to bed time that demand a lot of attention and energyAs far as your nightmares there could be many causes contributing to them Certain foods many of the ones mentioned or medications could be the culprit Doing a bit of research into the ones you are consuming may help you eliminate the offender You may also benefit from talk therapy with a qualified therapist to discuss any underlying issues you are experiencing Oftentimes depression and anxiety can manifest themselves during sleep causing nightmares Finally Yoga has shown to be very beneficial for quality sleep There are many instructional videos available that can introduce you to the practice if youd rather not join a class right away Best of luck to you and I sincerely hope you are able to catch up on some well deserved Zs
"unacceptable, struggling, forget, forgive, trust issues, relationship, children, hurt, move forward",First of all my heart goes out to you Infidelity is an extremely challenging obstacle to overcome There are some things that you should consider First of all did he seem truly remorseful If you felt in his heart that he was truly sorry for what he had done it will give you a piece of mind that it was a  mistake Secondly was he forthcoming with this information How about with answering your questions after the truth was uncovered If you found that he was still lying or not forthcoming the sting is even more painful He should be able to answer any question you have honestly and without hesitationThirdly has he shown a positive difference after this experience At this time he should still be proving his faithfulness to the marriage you and the childrenKeep in mind that experiencing infidelity is a form of grief It is not a quick process that can easily be overcome What you are experiencing is 100 normal My best suggestion would be to see a marriage therapist Find out what drove your husband to cheat in the first place and decide if this aspect in his life has been resolved I know its important for you to keep your family together but children can sense anger and frustration this is not a healthy environment either If you decide that you can no longer remain in the relationship a therapist will also be able to help you cope with the separation along with addressing your childrens needsPlease know that you are not alone and that unfortunately many relationships have endured this very thing It may also be helpful to reach out to people who have experienced similar obstacles The web is a great resource to find groups whether online or in person to use as a support or sounding boardBest of luck to you and your family
"medical issues, no sex drive, shut down, closed everyone out, divorce, devastated, seeing someone else, work things out, not sure, jealous, serious",Im sorry to hear about your current situation My heart goes out to you during this timeFirst of all it is of vital importance that you discuss your symptoms with your doctor Regardless of whether you are able to mend your relationship with your husband you need to address the physical issues you are experiencing More than likely heshe will be able to help you relieve some of these symptomsSecondly you must be upfront and honest with your husband Intimacy is a large part of a relationship and it is unfair to your husband that you did not disclose how you were feeling I think he would appreciate knowing that it was your medical problems causing the lack of sexual desire as opposed to the reason being himIf you explain to him that you are addressing your sexual issues with your doctor in order to enhance your relationship he may be more willing to see that you are serious in wanting to mend the relationship The conversation will be hard to explain to your doctor and your husband since it is of such a personal nature but it will be extremely beneficial And please note that the reason for the feelings you were experiencing or lack thereof was not your faultBest of luck to you and your husband
"broke up, loves me, not in love, happy together, visit family, changed, missed family, quit job, drove 15 hours, apologized, pregnant, trying to get pregnant, hard to accept, treated her the best, losing my family, losing my mind.",I am sorry to hear of these troubles  I see a few issues here  I wonder why you were both trying to get pregnant when the relationship seemed troubled  Some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant and all this does is bring up more problemsYou say you never treated her badly and I believe you  People in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on  In fact giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a self outside of this relationship can be unhealthy  It takes two whole healthy happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole healthy happy couple in a relationship  Expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to workThere are two books that I recommend you buy and read  One is Codependent No More  The other is Can My Relationship Be SavedSometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone it makes you both miserable  You cannot change her and cannot change her mind  Sometimes the best thing is to let go  If it is meant to be you will end up back together again  It seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving  I suggest backing off and letting her go  Maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind  If it is meant to be she will come back If not use this time to work on being a healthy happy you on your own
"emotions, symptoms, situations, talk with parents, love, personalities, not taken seriously, serious event, pansexual, trust issues, fought depression, stress, anxiety, friends not listening, childhood taken, lack of trust",Hi there Being 15 years old can be a very difficult time in your teenage life I remember when I was 15 and how I often felt my parents werent listening to me Its even more difficult when you feel that you do not have a friend that you can confide in Having depression in the past and being able to get through it shows me that you can get through anything Depression alone is a very difficult problem to work through In addition to the communication problem with your parents it appears that you are also struggling with stress and anxiety We all have stress and anxiety in our lives If we didnt none of us would be living Anxiety  stress keep us on our toes Often I have to remind myself of this as well However it is how we manage stress and anxiety so it will not overcome our lives Are you familiar with relaxation techniques such as deep breathing exercises meditation or yoga Relaxation Techniques can help you tremendously in reducing your stress and anxiety Deep breathing exercises are helpful when you are on the go such as school shopping out with friends or whatever extracurricular activities you engage in  Most people do not take full advantage of their lung capacity I know that sounds silly But its true You would be surprised how much air you lungs can hold Imagine being in the Doctors office and taking deep breaths This is what you want to do when you are feeling overwhelmed andor stressed Take a moment to take in at least 10 deep breaths and let them out slowly You will be surprised how well you feel afterwards Meditation and Yoga are also healthy forms to working through stress and anxiety You will need a quiet place for your meditation You want to be in the moment and take in the peace and serenity All it takes is a quiet place closing your eyes and thinking of your happy place Some people use meditation music as well If you have access to this type of music and or the internet for more ways to practice meditation please go for it Yoga on the other hand will take a little more work and practice I would not suggest you learning this on your own if you have never attempted yoga before Find an experienced Yoga instructor to teach you the ropes andor ask your school counselor about the possibility of getting someone to come to the school to teach the students Lastly in regards to your parents it is very important to be able to have a relationship where you feel comfortable communicating I would recommend writing a letter to them if you are unable to express how you feel in person A letter is more intimate and requires a little more effort on their end If they are open on working on this relationship maybe suggest family counseling to fully work on this issue I hope this was helpful for you and I wish you the best
"emotions, symptoms, situations, break up, cheated on, argue, not affectionate, tired, judged, love, need help, Christian counselor",I dont think youve lost something I think youve found something  your breaking point and its about time Your boyfriend seems to be a very selfish and immature man who reconnects with you when its convenient for him Obviously he has his own issues but I want to address yours I agree you need to talk to someone The fact that youve put up with his repeated cheating and then letting him blame you for it by saying youre not affectionate enough etc tells me you probably have low selfesteem and have likely told yourself over the years that you dont deserve any better You do You may truly love this guy but based on his behaviors he does not love you not in the way you deserve  And although you may want to believe he can change he has proved over and over again that hes not willing to so you need to do what is best for you and your children What would you tell your daughters if someone was treating them this way Would you want your sons to treat women this way Thats what youre teaching your children when they see thisLike I said I agree that you should talk to someone You can ask your boyfriend to go too but my guess is he wont Even if he does you should still see someone individually to work on YOU I understand its not easy to just kick him out especially since you have children together but a counselor can help you talk through all the details while helping you raise your selfesteem and selfworth
"emotional hurt, arguments, broke up, make it work, pregnant, miscarriage, extremely hurt, relationship, seeing other people, inappropriate pictures, confront, apologetic, mad, closed car window, throw out",There are plenty of red flags that you have been presented withSeveral breakups Not holding up his end of the bargain regarding workLack of empathy for your miscarriageLying about his involvement with another womanPhysical violence which is of most concern This seems to be a very unhealthy relationship In my experience relationships such as these rarely become positive ones Violence is never okay and regardless of his reasoning you looking through his phone it is indefensible You have to look at these red flags and ask yourself Is this really someone I want to marry Is he an asset to my life I think youll realize he is notBest of luck to you and please know that you deserve someone who treats you with kindness dignity and respect
"marriage, cheating, hurt, communication, lowest",Hi there Thank you reaching out for help It takes a lot of courage for someone that is being abused to reach out for help I want you to know that I am here to help you in any way that I can First and foremost you did not mention whether or not you had children yourself by this man Im going to assume there are So the most important thing right at this moment is asking yourself if you and your children are safe Is the boyfriend currently living in the home or is he coming and going If he is coming and going or currently living in the home my suggestion for you to is to pack a bag for you and your children and go somewhere safe ie family members home friend or a shelter temporarily I cannot stress this enough Although some people tend to minimize their abusers behavior ie they only do it when they are drinking they only do it when they are mad its those individuals that find themselves or their children in a serious situation So you can never take abuse physical or mental lightly because you never know what is going through that persons mind at that particular time Its always better to be safe than sorry Secondly it will not be safe helpful or productive to attempt to talk to the abuser about your relationship Abusers often times try and manipulate you into staying by apologizing or attempting to justify their behaviors This is the time you would want to go see a magistrate in order to get a protective order for you and your childrenIts unfortunate that your significant other was involved with another women causing pregnancy however that is no longer your concern Your concern at this point is keeping yourself and your children safe I would also suggest counseling for you and your children in order to work through these issues I hope this was helpful and please stay safe and take care of yourself
"emotions, disappointment, happy, jealous, envious, anger, upset, selfish, petty, control, ruining, mad, disappointed, move on",Its hard to let go of the dreams you had regarding your wedding and engagement This was something that you and most women think about for years so its understandable to be disappointed But please be aware that it is rare that any wedding is perfect You may envy your friends weddings but more than likely they had a few mishaps of their own andor it wasnt as perfect as they had planned it either However like you know the marriage is the most important thing  How many women are envious that you are in a happy stable relationship I assure you that there are plenty Try to live in the present considering that dwelling on the past can still not change how you were proposed to or how your wedding day transpired Focus on what you can control NOW Perhaps you can plan an extravagant renewal of your vows or change the look of your ringI would also be upfront with your husband and explain why youve been short lately But after that close that chapter and move on It sounds like you have a wonderful companion and you certainly dont want to lose this due to a situation that is impossible to change
"grieving, mothers death, cry every day, anyone to talk to, need help, still cry, stop crying, 3 years",I am sorry that you lost your mother That is a really hard thing for someone to go throughThere is really no set time for grief to be over but I agree that if it has been three years and you are still crying every day then this is past the time for normal grief  I do not know how old you are and if you are in school or have a job but I would imagine that if by now you literally were doing nothing but crying every day all day someone would have noticed and would have gotten you some help  For one thing bills have to be paidThere are typically five stages of grief and they can come in any order  You can go back to another stage that you previously experienced Denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance are the stages At first people are usually in denial over the fact that they lose someone or are losing someone  This may mean that you deny they are ill or deny that they have actually diedThen comes bargaining in which you may beg God that if you can only have this person back then you will do whatever Depression is when the reality has settled in and when we cry and really feel the loss  It sounds like you are stuck in this phaseFinally acceptance is when we accept that it has happened and we pick up the pieces of our life and move onWhen we lose someone we never forget them  We may always have certain days that are tough such as holidays or any special remembrance of your loved one  But we do get to the place where we accept that death is part of life and that it is inevitable and that life goes onA therapist can help you explore the reasons for your extended grief and can help you with coping skills to better deal with it  One suggestion I have is not to try to run from the sad feelings dont try to not feel them  Embrace the feelings  Let the feelings wash over you and accept them  Trying not to feel something is not going to help  Sadness is a part of life and needs to be felt just like happiness does  Unpleasant feelings are not to be avoidedI am sincerely sorry that you lost your mother and that you have had such a hard time of it for three years now  You deserve to be happy and to live a full life  I am sure your mother would not want you being sad for so long  I wish you all the best as you continue to try to heal from this loss and deal with your grief
"issues with my relative, police never believe, experiences, kid, trouble reaching therapist, adult help, advice",I think it would be wise for you to call a hotline especially designed for children Its called the Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline The number is 18004ACHILD 18004224453 It is completely anonymous and a trained therapist will be able to provide you with guidance confidentiality and can also help you make a report of you wantThe call is completely free and they are open 24 hours a day  7 days a week Im glad that you are taking steps to improve your situation You are a very brave and an intelligent child Please remember to call 911 if you are in immediate danger
"love, relationship, bored, in love, talking, met, emotions, son, problem, tell, what should I do",Hi there Wow this sounds like a sticky situation however Im here to help guide you through this decision First and foremost you must ask yourself if you ever loved your sons father or was it a situation to where you two got pregnant and stayed together for the child Its very common to stay with your partner when a child is involved regardless if love is involved or not because its the right thing to do Right Well not entirely  Although staying with your partner because you have a child together may seem right in fact it hurts the child in the long run If you are not love with your partner you will show distance unhappiness sadness possibility of frequent arguments and cheating  When a child grows up in the home and witnesses these types of emotions  behaviors it is unhealthy as heshe will expect their own relationships to be such As a responsible adult you are supposed to be there to shape and model the future for your child Just remember what you do your child will model Secondly do not sell yourself short from love Everyone deserves to be happy and to have someone to share their love and intimacy with However being in love with someone you have never seen before can be very risky Honestly that sounds like lust and the longing of love  Humans have needs and when people are unhappy in their current relationship they often seek out what they need  If you decide to pursue the second relationship I would suggest setting up an outing with a friend or two in order to get to know this person as there are a lot of scammers these days Finally I am not convinced that this has anything to do with choosing between two guys  This seems as if you are making a decision to end the relationship with your childs father or not You should ask yourself if you were in love with your childs father first off If you were you would have never sought after love  I hope this was helpful for you and I hope I was able to shed a different light on your situation Take care of yourself
"promiscuous past, boyfriend, love, disgusting, sexual distraction, handle",I am sorry to hear of your relationship struggles One thing I wonder is did you volunteer the information about your past or is this something that he asked about  In the future it is probably best to leave details out of conversations like this  I think it is common and natural for partners to ask about the sexual history  For one thing it is a good idea to be checked for STDs before entering into a sexual relationship with someone and it is fair to share that information with each other  Partners usually want to know how many you have been with and what kind of sexual preferences you have or if there is anything you dont like to do  This gets into a gray area for some people  I dont necessarily want to know how many people my partner has been with and I certainly dont want a whole lot of details  Sometimes that is an image I just dont want in my head about my partner  Vague details are usually enoughHowever I understand that your partner has the details and is not happy with your past  This is a reflection on him not you  This shows insecurities on his part  You cannot control how he will react to information that you provide to him and you cannot control how he feels about the information  The past should remain in the past and not be held against you in the present or future   If he cannot handle your past then it is going to cloud your relationship  You can offer couples counseling to him and see if he will go with you  I have seen relationships recover from some very serious problems such as infidelity  It takes two people who both want it to work to make it work though If your boyfriend cannot get over your past you may have to let him go  Dont keep yourself tied to someone who is not right for you  Constantly holding your past over your head and holding that against you is only going to bring you down and eventually you may start having insecurities or low selfesteem due to this type of treatment I dont see that you have done anything wrong  If you arent cheating on him now and you answered his questions about your past honestly how he handles that information is on him  Ultimately relationships have a tendency to come and go Dont fight to hold onto someone who is not right for you  It is okay to be single and enjoy being the best you that you can be  In time the right person for you will enter your life
"anxieties, pressured, unable to speak, body image issues, self-confidence issues, invalidated, paranoid, guilty, worthless",Im sorry to hear that you are unable to get through to your parents It sounds like you are experiencing a great deal of anxiety that needs to be addressed by a professional despite the fact that you are unable to at the moment I would recommend talking with another adult such as a  school counselor that can offer you support in this area Perhaps they can work with you on your anxiety issues and schedule a meeting with your parents so that heshe may help mediate the conversation with themIf you are unable to reach out to a school counselor maybe you can try a member of the family such as an aunt or an uncle that feels comfortable addressing the issue with your parents Sometimes it helps hearing it from a third party before the situations is taken seriously enoughGood luck
"abused emotionally, keep getting with men, emotionally abused, mistakes in my life, hard time getting back on my feet, help me",I want to applaud you for taking this first step towards realizing that this is an issue and wanting to do something about it  You are already on the road to a happier life with this realization  A lot of women do not recognize that it may be something about them that continues to attract a man like this and will only blame it on the men for treating them that way  Until you realize there is a problem you wont start looking for a solutionDont misunderstand me  The abuse is not your fault You are seeing a pattern though so this does need to be addressed First go and buy the book Boundaries Where You End and I Begin by Anne Katherine  Read it  This book describes many situations that are similar to yours describes how a person came to be that way and how to stop it  You will have to learn to set good boundaries in your life and to maintain themBe single for a while  Stay single until you feel like a whole healthy happy person on your own  Often we get in a relationship because of a need  If you feel like you need a person in your life to make you a whole person then you are in a relationship for the wrong reasons  The first step is to work on whatever it is in you that makes you feel like you need another person in your life  Identify those needs and then learn to fulfill them on your ownI was doing a couples therapy session and the husband was being emotionally abusive to the wife  This was a recurrent theme for her like you are saying it is for you  However she had been doing a lot of work on her own and in private therapy and this was a new relationship  Obviously she still had not gotten it right because she did once again attract a man with these tendencies  The difference this time was that she had done a lot of work on herself and had become a stronger person  When she looked at him in our session and said to him I dont need you I want you  But not if you are going to continue to act like this  So you leave the house and dont come back until you are ready to make some changes  She stuck to that too  He didnt leave for two more days because he kept telling her he would do different and begging to be allowed to stay  She had drawn a boundary and stuck to it and he left She was fully prepared to be single again  They actually did end up working things out in the endYou cant let someone stay and continue to treat you badly  Sure a marriage takes work and compromise on both sides  Couples therapy can help you both learn to communicate in a healthier way with each other and can help you realize what areas in the relationship need work  You may not realize how some of the things you say to him comes across and he may not realize how what he says does to you  A therapist can help you with this so that you both learn how your words can hurt But you need to know your boundaries and be prepared to stick to them and not compromise your boundaries  That means following through on the threat to leave when he continues to abuse you  Someone cant do that if they are too scared to be alone  If they feel they need the other person in their life These patterns are developed in early childhood from what we learn from our parents  When someone has grown up in a dysfunctional family it is all they know  Even when you can say that you realize it is a problem you still dont know how to stop it because you never learned any other way of interacting with people  Something that took a lifetime to learn will take time and work to overcome  Be patient with yourself and find a good therapist  You cant change your partner  Work on you and when you begin to heal and feel healthy the right people will come into your life and stay  The more you focus on trying to change the wrong ones to be what you want the more frustrated you will become
"belittled, insecure, frustrated, shortfused, temperamental, lack of communication, condescending comments, inconsiderate, negative, oblivious, self consumed, hurt",Do you have a close friend or relative whos opinion you trust Ask them for their honest feedback and if they see you like your cousin does If they dont see these qualities in you then it may be your cousins issue and shes taking it out on you You can always ask her what would be the best way to communicate plans with her so you know specifically what she is expecting Then if you meet these expectations and she still blames you and comments on how inconsiderate you are its her issue and she is not coming from a place of loveEven if you do resemble her comments the way it sounds like she approaches this problem is not out of love The fact that youre introspective enough to consider your own behavior suggests the problem is not with you
"child with my baby mother, young son, cheating, putting me down, doesn't love me, fight, hard time, raped by a family member, family issues, annoying, belittles me, work, watch the baby, days off, cooks, cleans, no friends or family, confiding to some guy, don't want to leave",It sounds like you are in a tough situation You have to ask yourself why you dont want to leave her Is it because of the child Or is it because you want the relationship to work You must consider that being in an abusive relationship is not healthy for you or your child So if the abuse continues it would be more beneficial for you and your child to move outOn the other hand if you are just wanting the relationship to work out despite its current state you need to evaluate whether the relationship is worth salvaging It seems as though you are very unhappy and undervalued in this relationship Although your question revealed just a short bit of information I didnt read about any positives in the relationship Sometimes its extremely hard to leave a relationship even though you know that the relationship itself is harmful for you However with time and focus you can do it Each day will get a little easier and you have to trust yourself that you are making the right situation for you and your childHowever if you really feel that you want to stay in the relationship you have to be upfront with her You need to tell her exactly how you feel and give her specific examples of how she is hurting you This gives her a chance to render the situation If after this there is no improvement I suggest that you start reconsidering your decision to stayI also think it would be valuable for you to start engaging in things outside of the home that make you happy Are there any hobbies you enjoy Are there any groups in the area that you can join such as playgroups that will allow you to engage with other parents Start looking into these options and finding an avenue for you to do something for your own benefitIt is certainly not healthy for you to isolate yourself from friends and family You need to have additional support networks besides the one with your girlfriend especially since this has not been a healthy environment latelyThank you for reaching out I wish you the best of luck with your relationship
"happy, excited, staying up late, sleeping too much, feeling worthless, no interest, staying in room, want to be happy, want to be nice",Im sorry to hear that you are feeling as if youre in a slump First of all nothing is wrong with you Many people report similar symptoms Have you ever talked with a physician regarding your symptoms Two extreme emotions such as feeling extremely happy and then feeling extremely low for a length of time may indicate a mood disorder I think it would be best to talk with your doctor or a therapist to help pinpoint the issue causing themIts possible that it could just be certain stressors in your life that are causing the two extremities but you definitely want to rule out any mental health issues If it is in fact mental health related there are many medications or therapy choices that can help Thanks for reaching out I hope that you will feel back on track soon
"emotional wrecked, closure, depressed states, better myself, genuinely busy, abandoned, relationships, wrong with me, care about, be around me",Frequently when working with clients I utilize the ABC model developed by Albert Ellis the founder of Rational Emotive Behavior Theory The theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event For instance here is an exampleA Action or Event You need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you backB Behavior or Response You begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or I am not important to this personC Consequence You feel depressedIf you look at the model B has a direct effect on C The thought is if you change your reaction to A then C will have a better consequence such asA stays the sameB this is what you change This person must be busy they will call me back when they get a chance or I can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is availableC Decreased feelings of depression  overall functioning improvesThis is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve If this model resonates with you I recommend Feeling better getting better staying better by Alber Ellis In addition looking for support groups in your area are a great source of support when you are feeling abandoned or alone
"cheated on, pregnant, physically abusive, mentally abusive, attempted to talk, blames me, help, discredits me, hurtful, crying, feeling lonely, unhappy, unsure",That sounds like a very hurtful situation Unfortunately without a batterers intervention course or a desire to change the abuse cycle is unlikely to stop I do not recommend that you try to leave on your own due that being the most dangerous time when in an abusive relationship As an abuser his goal is to control you whether its through mental or verbal means I recommend that you contact a domestic violence shelter in your area I have worked closely with Harbor House of Central Florida and know they provide housing transportation and any other needed resources to women leaving an abusive relationship There is help out there and you are not alone If you need any additional resources in your area please dont hesitate to contact me
"emotions, forgiveness, love, dating, sex offender, plea, past, unforgiving, family, granddaughter, dump",Thank you for your question Trust is a huge thing in relationships and when that is broken or perceived as being broken it takes a long time to repair From what you shared it sounds like your boyfriend took steps to correct the situation and has shown to be trustworthy since Unfortunately no matter how much we apologize for something we did or for something others perceive we did there will always be those with hardened hearts and will not forgive If you feel confident in your relationship then trust your inner wisdom We cannot control others but only ourselves Respect your families wishes to remain in unforgiveness while at the same time ask them to respect your wish to believe in him and be in this relationship Good luck to you

"self esteem issues, great guy, attractive, great personality, feel better, thinking about her, leave for college, depressed, helpless, don't know what to do",Hey  It takes a lot of courage to share your feelings with someone  And it sounds like you have been lucky to meet someone who makes you feel safe enough to explore some of your more painful feelings  A big part of the process however of strengthening your selfconcept is learning how to tell yourself those positive messages that you heard from your friend  Leaving for college may also be contributing to your feelings of unsteadiness  Try this  Make a list of all of the positive things that you know are true about yourself  Ask your friends and family to contribute to the list  Then carry it with you in your wallet  and when you need a selfesteem boost take a look at it  You are in a season of life that presents lots of challenges and opportunities  Reach out to your longdistance friend when you need support  and take a walk over to the campus counseling center and check out what they might have to offer  Be Wise
"beautiful lady, love, heart, boys, daughter, grandchildren, tearing us apart, family, happy, mistake, leave, love, save my marriage, boys, work it out, love, family, advice, hope, heart broken",If your wife is willing seek out a qualified couples therapist Look for one trained in the Gottman Method or Emotionally Focused Therapy Your relationship is repairable but you may need some qualified support in the process
"anxiety, lack of libido, intimacy, romance, hectic schedule, fake orgasm, honest conversation, lying, sex life",You are newly married you Have a hectic schedule your wife is on anti anxiety medication What if you take the focus hint pressure off of her orgasms and focus instead on connecting with one another You know like the gestures you each likely made while dating  It turns out that these little moments of connection throughout our days are actually foreplay Spend a few weeks making a real effort to focus on building up your little daily moments of connection I wrote a post about this a while back you can find it here httpconnectfulnesscomlittlemoments And have fun with it
"hopeless, not good enough, trying hard enough, worn out, worked on family relationships, doing great in school, kind to those in need, stick to religious beliefs, leave room for mistakes, learn from others, suggestions, ideas",Hello and let me say first what a great question There are so many people putting forth their 100 everyday and often times do not get the credit they deserve Without being able to fully understand where youre question is coming from I think there are a couple of different ways to look at this questionFirst I think its important for us to consider the message being sent by those in your life stating that youre not good enough Is that ACTUALLY what they said or is this just what you heard Sometimes because of our own selfdoubts and fears we skew and misinterpret the messages we receive from others Again listen to the message being sent and attempt to remain objective Is the message being sent coming from a place of love or concern If so have an honest and open communication with that individual about what your concerns are regarding the amount of energy and time youre spending on being good enough Explore with them how you feel your already giving your bestIf the person is unwilling to work at understanding this concern you have then it may be time to explore the relationship Some relationships we engage in can be toxic especially if the other person is toxic It may be they have their own stuff going on and they feel the need to constantly put others down to make themselves feel better If youre in the direct path of this individual then it serves to reason you will probably be in the direct fire as well Explore whether or not you want this relationship to continue in your life If its a relationship that MUST continue then work on what you will do to distance yourself from their toxicity or their problems Until theyre willing to work on these issues for themselves then it may be necessary to find an exit strategy such as leaving the room or simply refusing to engage in the conversation Another perspective of this question is exploring the reason why its important for YOU to satisfy the expectations of these other individuals NO ONE will ever be 100 good enough for EVERYONE Every single person has their own set of expectations in themselves and expectations in others It would be impossible to satisfy all of those expectations for every single person in our lives The question becomes what is it WITHIN you that feels the need to meet these expectations There is most likely a part of you yourself as an individual that feels less than and feels as if you yourself are not good enough It then becomes impossible to every feel good enough for others because its really YOU youre trying to feel good enough for If you already feel as if youre doing everything you can do to be at your best version of yourself then really work on LETTING GO of the rest No one is perfect and striving for perfection in our lives only creates more anxiety and stress Find a middle ground in which you are happy with your accomplishments and your daily goals and learn to let go of whats left After all tomorrow is a new day and you can work on more of your goals tomorrowI recommend doing this by finding a mantra a statement or phrase you can repeat to yourself anytime you start to feel that sense of stress and pressure from striving for perfection The mantra can remind you to let go of this expectation you have for yourself or that others have for you so you can also let go of the stress and anxiety surrounding the expectation I leave you with one of my favorite quotes that perhaps you can use as your mantra No one can make you feel inferior without your consent   Eleanor Roosevelt
"losing feelings, love, obsessed, space, okay, better, stress, sad feeling, great guy, effort, talking, couple, advice",Im willing to bet that this isnt what you are hoping to hear but Id suggest giving him space Ooph thats a tough one right I know But heres the thing when you keep trying to process and talk it out with him you keep pushing him away He needs to feel like a solid and whole person as you do too to be able to be fully in your relationship Its the work of being in relationship to learn this I get that this is tough stuff I wonder outside of being with him how do you soothe and calm yourself Thats the stuff for you to tune into and focus on right now
"regret, hurting, love, nothing, work, with them, matters, kids, raising, another guy",How you you expressed your regret and taken responsibility for the pain thus far Repair is a very essential skill in and part of developing healthy relationships Your love sounds deep sit with that Also sit with how shes been hurt You get to feel your hurt too and your kids In feeling all this you may also find our way to the repair If feeling all this is tough to take on seek out a local therapist to support your process
"grabbed my boobs, exchanged some texts, a few calls, met him for lunch, ended up kissing, serious, saw us kiss, told my husband, happy, divorced, called me, told her more stuff, trying to work things out, hard time believing, help him believe",The issue at hand here is that youre betrayal broke his trust In order to repair your relationship you will both need to confront the infidelity And both of you will need to honor yourselves by communicating your feelings and ensuring that those feelings are heard and validated It would be really helpful to do this work with a Gottman or Emotionally Focused Couples Therapist Gottmans The Science of Trust and What Makes Love Last would both be helpful reference books to guide you along
"end my present relationship, reassurance, busy work schedule, frustrated, angry, priority, anxiety, depression, panic, unhealthy, reconciliation",Sounds like your panic is less about loosing the relationship you are in which by the way doesnt sound like its meeting YOUR need for connection and more about being alone Being with him is serving you even if the relationship is less than ideal from being alone Being alone can be scary Youd have to face yourself Youd have to learn to love and care for and cherish yourself All important skills and tasks in maturing and growing up but scary none the less What ifWhat if you gave yourself permission to be in a relationship with YOU
"sensitive to stress, sensitive to a negative tone of voice, harmful impact, negative communication, self-fulfilling prophecy, frustrating, advice",With any type of criticism it is usually best to introduce the topic at a neutral time ie when both of you are relaxed with no current stressors involved having fun etc  Begin with a nonjudgmental reflective comment about a recent bothersome event as if it were just then crossing your mind therefore not something youve been consumed with ruminating over  eases the impulse for him to dive straight into defense modeThen share how you felt at the time of the event  Just say when I felt kind of hurt  shocked or whatever the feeling was  PERIOD  THATS ALL YOU SHOULD SAY  Wait for him to respond to your matteroffact statementNo matter what his response is stick to your same message  dont get overwhelmed by trying to rephrase or explain your view as that will likely set you up for continued arguing  You can even add I agree I could have misunderstood  it event I just know it made me feel uneasyHere you give him little wiggle room for a debateGood luck  Id love to hear how it goes
"losing it, questioning sanity, secret cell phone, holding a conversation, talking to himself",A rare topic  likely extremely troublesome for you I would need to have more background information on the two of you before beginning to offer any insight Feel free to email meI would also like to add that aside from the reality of whether or not these conversations are actually occurring as your partner he should be just as concerned about something that is disturbing you to this level  Partners need each others trust and support no matter who is right or wrong
"girlfriends grandma passed away, very close, took care, returned to normal, hit a brick wall, intimacy fell off, cant connect, open and expressive, short answers, no interest in sex, touching, something felt really off, insecure, thoughts of cheating, something is really off",Grief has a huge impact on us and everyones reaction is different The one common reaction however is to shut down and distance ourselves Her relationship with her grandmother was close given she took care of her up until she passed It sounds like she is working through a difficult loss and her ability to connect with you or anyone else is likely low right now Trust what she is telling you and try to be there for her as she works through it If she finds it too difficult to connect again a good grief counselor can help her get back on track
"separated from husband, stood by, affairs, talking to other women, pregnant, drug abuse, verbal abuse, physical abuse",It usually boils down to a lack of self esteem self love and self acceptance If for whatever reason the scripts we have been told about ourselves from others or what we have witnessed as children has become our beliefs about what to expect from life and others have been negative it is hard to imagine a different reality for ourselvesIf what we have learned and observed in our close environment has not taught us and inspired a healthy self esteem then we can not know what it is and how it feels like It is as if we lack the language the words to define it and the skills to practice itPutting up with a loved ones drug addiction their infidelity lack of respect and esteem verbal and physical abuse tend to show and reflect the degree of our lack of self esteem lack of sense of self worth lack of belief that we are worth and deserve more from lifeSeparating was the first step towards reversing this negative situation Spending time on your own and distancing yourself from your past experiences with him will give you a better and clearer perspective The fact that you are asking yourself this question shows that at some level you are aware that something is not quite right It is just a matter of finding out exactly what it is how you got where you are now and how to get where you want to get in your life in the futureWorking with a therapistcounselor will help you understand the mechanisms and learn how to build a healthy sense of self esteem Get a good sense of who you are and what you want And finally design the right strategy and plan of action to achieve your goal to move on in a healthy mannerYou have made the first step it is now a matter of being consistent in seeking help and doing the work until you achieve what you want Become who you want to be and create the life you want for yourself
"upset, cheating, forgive, move on, unfaithful, caught me cheating, faithful, worried, unsettling, think about, advice",My first question for you would be to see if youve talked with her about it yet You mentioned you found outand I know this can be so painful It can also be frightening to bring up the experience when it hurts a lot when you feel so unsettled as you mention But you can look at this as a vital and important piece of information about whats happening in your relationship and an invitation to get really honest and genuine with each other You have a long history being together 9 years and a son so you are very bonded no matter what changes happen in your relationship It may be incredibly helpful to find a counselor you can both go talk with Having a third party who is neutral and cares about your process and hers can be such a relief when you need to discuss things you feel scared about Even just a few sessions can make a huge difference If this doesnt feel possible for you right nowask your fiancee for time to set aside for a meaningful hearttoheart talk Say youd like to set it up on the calendar and make sure you have a babysitter for your son Set aside at least 4 hours Let her know that youd like to hear her honest truth about whats going on and share with her your truth as well Its not a time for criticizing or condemning and I dont sense that is your intention at allyou have a great deal of love for her Speaking honestly and listening openly is an amazing gift both for yourself and for your partner You can do it
"depression, anxiety, psychiatrist, worse anxiety, strength left",Did you take the medication the way the psychiatrist prescribed it  Did you follow up with herhim to report how it was going  Different medications work differently with different people   Its not always the first one that helps  And some of the medications take some time to have an effect  Give the doctor the chance to help you I suggest you find a certified CBT therapist to help you examine your thinking  wwwAcademyofCTorg has listings of the finest CBT clinicians  In the meantime do some anxiety fasting by taking a few minutes to do something nice for yourself right now  I hope you feel better soon  Mark wwwMarkMorrisLCSWcom and wwwLivingYesorg

"abusive father, killed my rapist, lost custody, served 5 years, sad memories, close mother daughter relationship, cruel verbally, angry at the world, afraid of God, drank, cussed out, feeling guilty, afraid of being evicted.",Was either parent abusive or violent toward youYou sound to have suffered emotionally in your relationships since early in lifeOne point to consider is to strive for moderation in what you offer in relationshipsA lot of what youve lived through is extreme either as victim or perpetratorIf you imagine that apologizing to the custodian for the way spoke to him would calm him down do soAt the very least youll be actively resolving your guilt over cussing at him and fear of his retaliation
"therapist, gay, sexual issues, cares about me, friends, loaned money, paid me back, medical emergency, heavily medicated, credit card information, dropped me off, don't know what to do",Do you want this therapist to have your credit card informationIf not then cancel the credit cards that you believe may now be accessible to this therapistTherapists are expected to keep very clear boundaries between the therapy work and not have other relationships such as friend or money lender with someone who is their patientTherapists are never friends with their patientsLetting you believe that you are the therapists friend is a violation of professional ethics and almost definitely a violation of the Consumer Protection laws in your StateStart by dropping this person as your therapist  He has broken too many ethical standards to be worthy of offering therapyThink over if youd like remaining friends with this person whom you describe as lacking integrity and stealing from youIf you need help getting back money from him then contact the police and talk to a detective about what has happened so far  The detective will advise according to the laws in your community and State whether to file a police report and what steps are necessary to utilize the Court system to get back your fundsIf youd like doing future patients who may be treated to similar ways by this therapist a favor go online and file a complaint with the therapists Licensing BoardGood luck
"trust issues, betrayal, heartbreak, competition, insecurity, love, torn apart, feeling inadequate, feeling lost",Im sorry for so much stress in your relationship lifeIn what ways does your boyfriend express his commitment and positive feelings about you to youFrom what you write you feel more aggravation stress loneliness and insecurity than satisfaction by being in this relationshipDoes he care that you dont trust himVery often people stay in relationships from fear of knowing who they really are  The feeling is of needing a partner in a way that is similar to how a fearful child needs staying nearby a parentMy suggestion is to think over how much your sense of need for a partner may be preventing you from actually seeing the amount of love and investment in your relationship your boyfriend actually hasThese realizations are sometimes painful and frightening to understand especially if you grew up in a family that largely ignored or didnt adequately nurture you as a childA therapist for your Self may be a good investment of time and cost in giving yourself a safe and trustworthy space to think deeply about your best interest
"former husband, separated, sleeping with others, marriage, saved, part ways, care deeply, seeing someone else, marriage saved, try",Sorry to hear about the stress in your relationship  There is definite value in being clear as you are about your own emotional investment in your husband and that you expect sexual exclusivity from him as part of the foundation of your marriageAlso positive is your awareness that only your husband is the one who must similarly decide his own standards of being sexually exclusive to you or notWhether your marriage can be saved depends on what each person is willing to accept about the other oneIs sleeping with other women the only criterion of what will satisfy you about being together with your husbandLove and care are not enough to make a marriage work Partners need to be able to compromise and cooperate with each other That you care for him definitely intensifies any emotion you feel toward your husband  It intensifies any frustration and sadness about the relationship tooDecide how much emotional sadness and hurt youre willing to tolerate and the reason youre willing to do soFrom what you write you are being very generous of yourself and not being reciprocated for thisIf your husband doesnt start taking steps toward satisfying your wishes this may be your time to question your own generosity in waiting for him to do so
"narcissist sociopath, general manager, financially drained, emotionally drained, lost spirit, happy person, loner, moved to another state, working as a server, believe less in myself, pity for myself, money problems, hard time, need help",Congratulations on leaving your marriageIt is ok and natural to feel sadness loss uncertainty in direction hurt resulting from ending the marriagePossibly what you consider pity is a combination of these feelingsBe kind and caring toward who you are since you just put yourself through a major separation and need time to clear out the old emotions that connected you to your exThere is very very little chance of him helping you since he lacks compassion and empathyMore likely any help he gave would be in order to manipulate youMaybe for now your server job is ok do you have more time to concentrate on taking care of your emotionsYou were a manager once you can be a manager again when you feel ready for doing soGood luck
"ADHD, manic depression episodes, anger management problems, ODD bipolar, split personality, truly happy",The ADHD and manic depressive episodes are terms other people told you that you haveYou dont have to accept these words to describe who you areA lot of mental health in our country is about telling people whats wrong with them and giving pills for these so called conditions instead of helping a person know more about themselves in order to make good decisionsYou can be happy because nothing from the outside such as the names people have used to tell you who you are can interfere with your own wish to be happyOthers can slow you down because of the selfdoubt and hurt feelings  No one can take happiness from you only they can make it harder to find and hold ontoAnger management only works temporarily because it is a surface approachThink of the reason you are angry  This will be better to know so you will be able to address itThen you will not have anger to manage
"emotional, overwhelming feeling, cheating, accusing, wrong, shift in demeanor, feeling down, not confident, texted, hook up, working, out of line, crazy, need help, checking, something wrong.",Trust your intuition that your boyfriend is involved with other peopleYou gave examples which strongly suggest thisQuite commonly a person twist someones words to convince then of having problems in seeing or understanding their own and others behaviorYour intuition is again working quite well in telling you that your problem is having a boyfriend who manipulates you not that youre seeing things incorrectlyOne way to check if youre totally misreading him is to examine whether you feel similarly in other relationshipsIf no one else who knows you tells you that youre crazy then this strongly points to your boyfriend twisting words so that you feel wrongAlso a consult with a therapist would clarify the dynamics between you and your boyfriendA therapist session would also allow you to think out loud in a confidential discussion what to do with your newfound clarity
"problem with extended family members, inappropriately urinating, cat litter boxes, bottles, directly on floors, corners of my house, adults behaving this way, trying to understand",Hi This sounds like a very challenging and upsetting problem  good for you for reaching out My first thought is these two adults may have a sleep disorder that could be contributing to the urination in inappropriate places Since they are adults and you cant force them to seek treatment  you might be able to suggest that there could be an underlying medical issue and advise they speak with a medical provider  As far as what to do for yourself  set some firm boundaries Be clear about the expectations of your home Also include the positive and negative consequences should they decide to address or avoid this issue I hope this helps you your family members and the pets
"defending my son, incorrect approach, harsh behavior, encouraging our son, working on science assignment, upset, swearing, threatening, scared",I have had these many cases but in situations like this If it does get out of hand the police do need to be involved Sit down and talk to your husband when he is calm and collective
"trust issues, reading between the lines, difficult time, making a connection, deception, control my emotions, abusive, intimidate, false claims, immigration application",Im sorry to hear about being taken advantage of by your former wifeOn the positive side think of how much you learned by going through this very painful timeMaybe you are naturally very generous and caring to the point of expecting very little from the other person for exampleConsider yourself in a favorable position to not feel like going out right now and meeting a new person   Your spirit is guiding you to stay put and recuperate from this ordeal review for any signs you may have been more trusting than merited by the persons behaviorTheres a natural flow to what were able to handle and when we have renewed capacity for new adventuresTheres no reason to assume that youll never trust another woman again  The first step is rebuilding trust in yourself to step into a new relationship   There is no designated time line  Youll simply feel more ready than you feel nowVery unlikely that youd ever place yourself in a similar situation to the one youre currently recovering fromGood luck
"living in a hotel, don't have a family, bisexual, gay friends, not helping pay for room, TV remote control, slapped him, sick, visit and feed me, brags about house and car, struggles living at a hotel, whole house, orders me to text him, bath soap, trying to come back, loyal woman, treating me like this",I am less concerned about this man as bisexual and having gay friends than about how you feel is treating you  You are in a vulnerable position because of social isolation  If you have friends to talk to please reach out  While this man has money it is not his job to take care of you financially unless the two of you have decided that together  It sounds like he sometimes cares for you and other times you feel disrespected  I would suggest you look for a man that is consistent in his love and care  This is not your fault  But you are in control of removing him from you life or choosing not to because he meets some of your needs  Take care
"emotions, symptoms, situations, pregnant, boyfriend, parents, gynecologist, doctors appointments, supportive, lost, hopeless, guidance, wrong, keeping him away, communication, selfish",Youre not wrong for wanting to be with your boyfriend of three years who is also the biological father of your childDo your parents object to you and your boyfriend continuing to see each other in person  Or do they object only to electronic communication and dont want him involved in his childs life Ask your parents what their reason is for forbidding you to communicate with your boyfriend  Ask them also to understand your point of viewNow is also a good time for you and your boyfriend to plan whether and where you will live as a family and how to financially and emotionally support one another once your baby is bornYour mom and dad are definitely making fatherhood difficult for your boyfriend and motherhood stressful for youConsider bringing up the topic during your next obgyn visit  Your doctor may ask your mom to explain her reasons and address theseLook online for womens resources to see if there are clinics or agencies that would help you advocate for your position in this matterGood luck with the remainder of your pregnancy labor and delivery
"transition from male to female, wanted, persisted, don't know where to start, soundest information",Wonderful  I am so excited for you  What a huge decision  I am writing from Toronto Canada so it is hard for me to direct you specifically  I would start with two things 1 Find a doctor that is comfortable perscribing hormones and 2 find a Counsellor or Therapist that is transgender specialized  They will know how transitioning works in your health care system and other supports as well  Google is a wonderful way to find these resources   I wish you well Thanks for writing
"emotions, lost, sad, unwanted, love, separation anxiety, coping, challenge, break up, forgotten, not used to, tough, acting this way, out of town, travels a lot, new job, keep me up to date, talk with me",In a way yes you have separation anxiety Its normal in a relationship for us to slow down a bit with the attachment behaviours that establish and deepen love and connection So just because your boyfriend isnt talking as much or keeping you uptodate doesnt necessarily mean what you fear it meansthat hes forgotten about you or loves you less It could mean quite the oppositethat hes focused on being successful in his new job and impressing you He may think hes loving you more but you feel loved less You have two jobs to do here The first is to manage your anxiety by talking back to the thoughts it puts into your head It sounds like Its normal to be insecure but I have tons of evidence that he loves me and that I mean the world to him Find that evidence that helps you refute what anxiety is trying to claim The second part of your job is to let him know what you need You need more affection and connection during this period when hes away more texts phone calls information Its okay to want that and I am sure he will be relieved to know exactly what he can do to help you feel secure and calm when hes away
"Current medications, topamax, ativan, brintellix, lamictal, restoril, abilify, tx long term, dbt, cbt",The general prognosis for anyone is good so long as they have faith in their own ability to find the goodness in lifeFrom what you write the professionals may have so much focus on the drugs they give you that they have forgotten that you are a human being who has interests opinions feelings and thoughtsThe list of drugs you write sounds too long for anyone to reasonably needMy best suggestion is to find a therapist who does talk therapy not drug therapyDiscussing your fears and anxieties in a protected professional confidential space sounds like the first step to helping you believer your own conclusion about your wellbeingTaking a lot of drugs creates selfdoubt and weakens the sense of self that people naturally haveMy wish for your future is to regain trust and confidence in yourself as a person not a diagnosis who is told to take a lot of pills
"emotions, divorce, detachment, relationship issues, unhealthy dependency, mental health disorders, depression, bipolar disorder, therapy, seeking help, detachment disorder, mental block",This sounds really difficult and I can understand your motivation to get to bottom of why this behaviour has occurred  especially if your husband who sounds like he is an exhusband continues to have a relationship with you and your children With that being said  relationships and mental health are very complicated and you are unlikely to find the answers you are looking for In order for someone to be diagnosed with a mental illness or in order for them to identify what leads them to fall into particular patterns in relationship  they would need to be willing to seek help and honestly talk about their challenges something that you say your ex is not willing to do  While it might be a relief to understand what is going on with him  it might be more comforting for you to get support for yourself in processing your feelings and everything that has come up for you as a result of his choices
"erectile dysfunction, suffering, tried Viagra Cialis, sexually frustrated, sex with other men, okay",Hi First and foremost I want to acknowledge your efforts to gain your ideal erectile function If the medications are not working and you have taken them as prescribed I would encourage you to seek the help of a sex therapist as the dysfunction may be due to a psychological andor relational issue rather than a physicalmedical one As for your question only you can answer this Is it OK Are you OK with her sleeping with others Have you thought through what this may look like feel like become for you and her Opening up a relationship is a choice only the people in the relationship can answer Even then the answer may change at any point by either of you I encourage you to also determine what the intention is underneath your telling your girlfriend she could sleep with others Be clear with the intention and then together have continuous conversations about the expectations of opening up ie are there any kinds of sex that is off limits areas of the body where touch or intimacy is not allowed are uses of safer sex required or not do you want to know the details or not so forth An excellent resource would be the book Opening Up by Tristan Taormino I wish you the best of luckDr Lily Zehner MFTC
"problems, drama, arguments, incident, concern, argument, frustration, hurting, party, control, schedule, threats, ugly, battle, children, crazy, misunderstandings, pickup details, decisions, emotions, situations",Hi I appreciate your mature instincts and strong efforts to draw clear boundaries in this very complex situation I agree that it sounds like the adult drama is unnecessary and potentially will affect the children Children need adults around them to act maturely cooperatively and peacefully even when they dont like each other it helps them feel secure and lets them focus on learning and growing Your exboyfriend seems more focused on his own needs In fact he demonstrates behaviours that are aggressive controlling and manipulative bordering on parental alienation I agree this is a problemI also appreciate how protective you are of yourself at this vulnerable time with the pregnancy Its not unusual for pregnancy to trigger a need to conserve energy and reduce stress Honour this instinct you have I will suggest a few things to you First to gather support around you professionally if you need it from family and friends and certainly from your husband If you two are on the same page regarding the children issues and your ex that will help He can help run interference when it comes to his daughter It will help you feel supportedKnow that your exs behaviours arent happening because you did anything wrong its the way he operates and maybe this is why youre not with him You cant change him but you can stop blaming yourself for his immaturity and aggression Youre correct that he will always be there and you can both accept this fact and also find ways to manage the situationKeep on defining clear boundaries You might sound like a broken record Youll have to talk to my husband about that but thats okay Its okay to ignore his efforts to pull you into an argument or power struggle Its okay to not respond to texts or other communications that arent vitally important Its okay to not let him into your house if it makes you uncomfortable Its okay to not engage with him more than is necessaryRegarding his manipulative behaviours that reflect a tendency to keep your daughter from you I recommend you document these behaviours and incidents carefully and fully Let him know what your expectations are simply and clearly and in writing our agreement states X and you are not following our agreement Your daughter doesnt have to be aware I think you already understand that she needs to be protected from the adult conflictA professional therapist can help you with all of this I hope this helps get you started towards greater peace at least within yourself
"emotions, closure, sexual tension, connection, worry, commitment, closure, moving on, happiness, racing mind, hung up, talk it out, blow up, crushed, terrified, move forward, cut off, help",If youre in a relationship and youre having strong thoughts about someone else its important to pay attention to that Although you say youre happy Id suggest looking really carefully at the relationship you have and whether youre getting everything you need Is there a physical connection with your ex that you dont have with your current boyfriend It could be that your boyfriend is marvelous in many areas but that you just dont feel excited about him for some reason Thats a pretty important element to be missingIt may be that even if you are happy with your current boyfriend you still hold something special for your ex If you feel the need to see what is possible there I think you have to tell your boyfriend about that and end it with him first You cant have everythingIf you truly feel that you want to be with your current boyfriend you will do well to stop thinking about and focusing on your ex because thoughts of him will interfere with the growth of your current relationship The grass isnt greener A therapist can help you to focus your energies and thoughts on the present rather than an imagined version of the past or future
"crying, dropping a glass of water, forgotten a shirt, shake, begged, emotions, symptoms, situations",It is very typical for pregnant moms to feel completely emotionally and extremely teary eyed so not to worry Biologically speaking your body generates an influx of hormones that affects you neurotransmitters chemical messages to the brain that takes you on an emotional rollercoaster but thats a good thing for the baby Everyone reponds differently to these changes in mood ranging from being anxious to being depressed However it is mostly heightened in the first and third trimester There is no guide as to how to handle these emotions but engaging in various sensory activities like walking yoga swimming listening to music may alleviate your mood Embrace the emotions that go along with pregnancy and know that it is within the norm
"emotional, past trauma, love, cheating, forgiveness, attention, leaving, coming back, normal",Im sorry that you lost your first born child  Death of a child always leaves a permanent reminder to the parents of a very painful time in their livesThe good news is your awareness that you and your wife are not connected in a satisfying wayThere are many possible areas to examine in your relationship as partners and as parentsIf what you write here are your observations and theories about your wifes outlook and conclusions then the first step is to directly have conversations together on the topics you write hereWhat needs clarifying is what her reasons are for wanting to leave the marriageOften a crisis such as a childs death motivates someone to look deeply into other intimate relationships  Keep in mind that looking deeply doesnt necessarily mean leaving the marriageAlso be aware of your own frustrations and marital discontent  Be ready to talk about your feelings and uncertaintiesThere is no such thing as one happy partner in a marriage and one unhappy partner   Each person is part of a system and can only be as satisfied as their partnerThe conversations that open relationship hurts and disappointments hold a lot of emotion  They are difficult to keep on trackBest recommendation is to find a couples therapist who will be neutral to each of you as individuals and help both of you examine the true health of the relationship
"attracted, dear friend, relationship problems, family dreams, flirtation, making out, keep it quiet, hoped, not over it, maintain the friendship, feelings, constantly touching, drawn to him, fantasizing, not interested, checking me out, get him out of my system, maintain the friendship",It sounds like a tricky situation If you want to maintain your friendship and continue to have regular contact with him getting over him may not be possible What makes it even trickier is that his actions hugs and touching may be misleading and are allowing you to believe that a romantic relationship is possible Some ways in which we naturally get over others are when we fall in love with someone else or when we suddenly see the person we like in a more negative or unattractive light If you truly want to force yourself to get over him cutting contact or setting strict boundaries may be necessary If you dont see him over time you can begin to forget about him If you set boundaries by discontinuing to allow the hugs and touches you will not feel mislead or have the idea in your mind that he is being flirtatious or interested It would be difficult to continue the relationship as is and expect your feelings to change Thus being proactive by talking to him about boundaries or cutting contact with him are two things you can do that will likely help you to get over him Good luck
"anxiety issues, relationship, depression, vomit, emotional nightmare, semirelationship, nerve problems, fear, brighter future, medications, forums, sister, similar problems",Hi HelenaI felt a bit sad when I read this This is a new term for me semirelationship What does it mean I know that todays culture for young people is more of a hookup culture than a dating one Maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore That makes me feel sad I hear a lot of young women Im not sure youre female but thats my guess say that they struggle with hookups because they cant let themselves hope for a phone call after a hookup Research tells us that after a hookup college age women tend to feel used and unworthy and men tend to feel guilty I think this scenario works better for men than women but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the endThis is only one possible explanation for your anxietythat your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether its okay to want or expect thatMaybe take a moment and listen to anxiety Anxiety tends to try to convince us that somethings wrong with us or something bads going to happen Anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague its more difficult to refute it then but you can try to clarify its whisperings by asking yourself these questions What am I afraid of What is the worst thing that might happen here Then what might happen and what would be the worst part of that Keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen Might someone not want youmight you feel rejectedor feel not good enoughyou might get hurtThen when you find that core fear you can look at your life and I bet youd find a place where that idea or fear originated A big moment or many smaller ones when you actually DID feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt In the end its a feeling youre trying to avoid not life or relationship and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious But this doesnt work for you Good With the help of a qualified therapist you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm confidence
"affecting my driving, going on more often, not all the time",Its important to make an appointment with a neurologist and ophthalmologist ASAP for evaluation There are medical conditions that can create this effect
"severe anxiety, depression, panic attacks, suicidal, self-harming, fear, scared, loud sounds, conflict, public places, medication, psychiatric service dog, calming, happier, help without medication",It sounds like you have been a positive support for your fiancee There is no doubt that this situation is a great challenge for the both of you While it may feel like you are responsible for her health and happiness it is important that you understand that you on your own wont be able to resolve her mental health issues Based on what you have explained it sounds like she needs to get a medical andor psychiatric evaluation Whether or not she decides to take medication is her and your decision but keeping an open mind about treatment options is important I suggest that she see a therapist on her own in order to better understand and cope with her anxiety and depression especially given her suicidal thoughts You would also likely benefit from therapy individual or couples therapy in order to address how you are feeling and best learn how to support her and your relationship I wish the very best for both of you and hope that things will improve sooner than later
"anxiety, self-loathing, young adult, virgin girl, boyfriend, first kiss, worry, waiting forever, lose virginity, first boyfriend, bad temptations, hooking up, oral sex, nice guys, relationship, dirty, pressured, surprised, good looking, tall, sports, excellent grades, university, approached, date, family relationships, single forever.",I think one of the first questions that springs to mind for me is whats the rush  Just because other people in your circle have had experiences that you are still warming up to does not mean that theres something wrong or something to be ashamed of  If anything I want to commend you on the selfrespect you have in wanting to wait and share this most intimate of experiences with someone that will feel the same way about it  One of the most common distortions in our thinking is when we try to directly compare ourselves to others while these people and even those in your family share a level of closeness to you they are not exactly like you  they dont see or feel things in the exact same way as you nor do they share the exact same perspective Its important to be making choices for you and for your own desires and life goals  Once you stop comparing your happiness you may find that you are already experiencing it and allow more of your guard to fall down
"exboyfriend, lies, lazy, trust, borrowing money, debt, sob story, work refusal, playing games, drug habit, debt with bills, compulsive lying, spending money, good person, homeless person, epilepsy, antisocial, socialize, movies, video games, driving, pathological liar",It sounds like you have some ambivalent feelings towards your exboyfriend that are difficult to sort out You notice that there are both desirable and undesirable things about him and this is true of everyone to one degree or another One question that I would have for you is are you satisfied with your relationship with him as it currently stands Are you happy with the boundaries between the two of you or would you like them to be different Negotiating through conflict and establishing different boundaries are definitely things you could work on with the help of a therapist Another question I would have for you is what would it mean for you to find out what motivates his behavior Discovering the roots of such behavior is something that he would have to work on in his own therapy and not something that you and a therapist could discover without him
"emotions, hurt, love, serious, close, missing, hot, in love, crushed, torn, confused, extreme pain",Love doesnt hurtYour description of the relationship so far is that you are feeling a lot of emotional pain alongside a deep attraction for this womanIn some relationships the benefit of what draws us together with someone is being able to learn more about our own deep sense of who we are what we value and care aboutThis sounds more descriptive of your relationship than that it is a loving one  Your descriptions are of the womans life parenting and relationship dilemmas not about how much of an effort she is willing to make in her life so that the two of you are able to be together for the long termTry distinguishing your wishes to be loved by this woman with what actually is taking place in everyday lifeBeing aware of how much love youd like to give and receive is valuable selfknowledgeYour ongoing emotional wear and tear of all decisions about the relationship that affect you being the result of the womans choices sounds like the opposite of loveThe relationship is very useful as an access in selfunderstanding of your needs and wishes  It sounds like this is its main value in your life not that it is sustainable in realityGood luck
"implanting thoughts, nightmare, lost my kids, lost my job, unwilling participant, no longer trust, afraid, hypnosis",Given your experience of being imposed upon against your will and all the personal and professional loss that has come since your fear of what will happen if you undergo treatment and trust a therapist is understandable There is no technique or pill that can guarantee these thoughts will go away or be reversed however there are things that you can do which may help you to change your relationship to the thoughts and to the distress that they cause I understand that working with a therapist sounds risky given your experiences and at the same time a good therapist may be a beneficial resource in helping you deal with the intrusive thoughts cope with and alleviate the stress that they create and perhaps even lead to the alleviation of the thoughts themselves A therapist may also be able to help you discover strategies to work towards any goals you have around reconnecting with your children and working again If therapy feels too unsafe at the moment I would recommend looking into workbooks on how to deal with intrusive thoughts and coping with stress Some popular approaches that you may want to look into are mindfulness techniques Acceptance and Commitment Therapy or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy You may even be able to find some of these resources at a library if affordability is an obstacle
"emotions, low confidence, low self-esteem, fear of being cheated on, insecurity, sadness, gaining confidence, letting go, feeling beautiful, attractive personality, not liking the situation",Sorry to hear about all the stress in the relationshipYoure on the right track by knowing and sticking with your own standards of what qualifies as acceptable behavior by your boyfriendSince he was the one who broke your trust he is one in the position of earning back your trustThis is always a basic formula for couples therapy in which there has been infidelityUnderstand within yourself whether youd like being with your boyfriend and what youd like him to do so that you start feeling more secure in the relationshipIf yes then tell him what you now know about yourself as partner in the relationshipFor example some people who are getting over being cheated on would like knowing details about the affair person some people want to see the phone of the one who cheatedRecuperating after a cheating incident takes many monthsIf he tells you hed like earning back your trust give him some time to see if there is progress in this areaAs results unfold you will feel clearer on the direction your relationship is naturally takingAbout the girl at work she will feel less meaningful to you as you work together with your boyfriend on securing the relationshipShe has her greatest meaning right now because you are at the beginning stage of knowing what direction to takeAs you go along this road more than likely youll be more at ease in naturally finding a way of relating to her that feels ok to you
"emotions, lack of trust, insecurities, physical abuse, separation, secret relationship, confess, love triangle, affairs, hurt, shock, decision-making, torn apart",Hi Jayuya Im struggling in this moment with my own biases I have biases that are about respect and every individuals need for and right to respect Your husband lies cheats and physically hurts you He makes excuses and blames you for these behaviours and trains you to do the same He demonstrates many controlling and abusive behaviours And now in an attempt to manipulate and silence you he wants to have his cake and eat it too and suggests you should share him There arent many crumbs of this cake left for you are thereSo my biases about respect dont make me want to rescue you or tell you what to do I cant do that and I dont think either of those things will help you Id like to ask you some questions thoughAre you happy Do you know what happy is Do you know what respect is Are your children safe Are your children witnessing violence because if they are then theyre not safe Do you have supports Do your family and friends know whats happening in your life Have you ever been to a womens shelter Are you willing to sit down in an office with a professional who can help you think clearly Thats what I suggest These are big decisions you deserve some support I wish you the best
"voice in my head, weird and crazy things, never stop talking, thinking, talk to myself, lay in bed, weird stuff",Does the voice in your head sound different or the same as your own voice when you talk to people and go about your usual daily lifeThere is a great big difference in the type of problem youre having if you feel the voice belongs to someone besides who you areIf you are hearing selftalk of turning over in your mind what goes on in your life reflecting on alternatives either of what you would like to have done differently in a certain matter or anticipating what you will do in a future situation then the problem of the voice in your head may be from a high degree of stress or uncertainty in your life right nowTalking out loud can be a symptom of severe agitation restlessness loneliness and a sense that you are not understood by other peopleI would be as concerned about the voice in your head as I would be about the actual content of what the voice is talking about with you
"female freshman, male best friend, dated, parents, young, dating, sweet senior girl, Tim's heart, love, concern, college, term, help, girls, breaking up, torn up, crush, recover, relationship, support, feel better, love anyone",First off I think it is great that you are willing and able to help out your friend with issues regarding his current relationship despite the fact that you have feelings for him I think that the best thing you can do is let him know that you are there for him if he wants to talk about things You can also help by presenting options that he has and help him weigh out the pros and cons of his decision but ultimately he has to decide what to do Know that you wont be able to heal the pain he feels when his girlfriend leaves but you can be a friend to him by simply listening validating his feelings and understanding Regarding your question about being there for him without wanting to hook upIm not sure if that is possible If you care for him on more than a friendship level then that desire will likey be there for you no matter what Be careful that you take care of yourself and dont jeopardize your own happiness while trying to help him with his issues Good luck to you
"true identity, guilty, religious, boyfriend, sexual acts, parents, Christian, tempted, messages, aggravated, break up, school, brainwashed, yelling, stuck, track, support, slut, devil worshipper, separate life, adopted.",What a tough situation you must be in feeling torn between your parents and someone who is very special to you I would say the first thing you want to do is if you havent already have a calm reciprocal conversation with your parents telling them how you feel and letting them know what you need from them If communication attempts are unsucessful then you will need to make a decision with how you would like to move forward You unfortunately will not be able to change your parents feelings or opinions but you can agree to disagree on certain matters by keeping them separate from the relationship you have with your parents It always helps to try and see things from another angle You might want to for example try and understand your parents perspectives and let them know you understand that they are upset Validating others feelings can be very helpful with communicating effectively Are you living with your parents and do they support you If so are you willing to give that up should you decide to not follow their rules Know that there is nothing wrong with being happy with someone or loving somebody so deeply Your feelings and actions certainly do not make you brainwashed or a devil worshipper Not everyone will always approve of the choices we make and sometimes we need to be okay with that Best of luck to you
"struggling, test, mental, belief",Hello in Jacksonville It sounds like you are struggling with motivation to either take or study for a test  There could be several different causes  If you were being seen at my practice I would ask you to describe your selftalk when engaging in these activities during the different phases ie in beginning after a few days and after few weeks  Negative selftalk leads to increased disinterest and eventually tasks not being completed  It is great that you recognize that you have the tendency to not complete tasks that you start  Some questions that would be great to explore with a therapist are how often you start and stop tasks without completing themhow you are feeling when you choose to start stop a projecttaskhow many tasks do you complete  Sometimes we need to recognize list our accomplishments so that they do not go unnoticed   Do you ever feel like you are working against yourselfA licensed counselor in Jacksonville will be able to asses you and rule out or diagnose selfsabotaging depression anxiety or other possible contributing factors  Remember to continue to provide yourself daily motivation and encouragement towards your goals
"alcohol addiction, issues, past, drinking, behind my back, lying, missing beers, apologized, promise, New Years resolution, limit alcohol consumption, passed out, confront, snores, cannot sleep, overreacting, honest, good husband",Hi Los AngelesSo your husband is giving you mixed messages He says hes willing to cut back on the drinking but he drinks and hides it His behaviour is passive aggressive and immature which puts you into this position of having to act like a disapproving parent It sounds more like youre talking about an outofcontrol teenager than your partner Your husbands lying is sending a message I get to make my own decisions and you cant stop me might be it Underneath that maybe its I want to stop but Im ashamed that I cant and I dont want you to see my failures Ultimately as an adult he gets to decide what he puts in his mouth and if you try to manage that by monitoring how many beers he has you are pretty certain to get some fallout pushbackbacklash  How does his drinking affect you Thats where your voice has power rather than in counting his beers or setting him up to lie when hes passed out asking if hes been drinking seems confusing Youve mentioned snoring which I guess is a legitimate complaint If hes passing out thats a legitimate complaint When he drinks does he drive act aggressively or check out of the relationship avoid you All of these things are legitimate concerns and Id stick to talking about those rather than counting beers My guess is he has few other ways to cope with stress so he checks out with alcohol and it also helps him avoid your relationship But the problem is it makes it worse the more he avoids you then more you chase him with your questionsTheres a conversation that would be helpful here  It sounds like Ive tried to support you in your drinking less and its not working What are your goals for alcohol and how can I support you in that more effectively Id like to see you in a place where youre not micromanaging his drinking but focusing on the things that affect you What concrete supportive methods can you use with his agreement Can we get the alcohol out of the house Is he willing to seek treatment Lay your expectations out really clearly I wont count your beers but I cant tolerate lying You have to decide whats more important is it really the number of beers or is it something else What do you need to happen in order to want to remain in the marriage What does he need Does he let you know what isnt okay with him He might have trouble saying these things The drinking is only a part of the complex dynamic in your marriage A qualified therapist can assist in pulling this apart understanding it and changing the way you relate to each other
"anger, possessiveness, urges, push people away, blow up, possessiveness, hurt someone, beg for me, agonizing, painedfilled, wrong with me",What result are you hoping to get from the behaviors you describeMaybe start by comparing the results you see yourself receiving from your current interactions with how you would wish to feel from relating to othersSince you ask what is wrong with me there is a disconnect between what you are doing and what youd like in returnThis is true even with imagining doing harm to othersWhat are you really trying to accomplish for yourself by hurting othersBesides the unethicalness and criminality of this and legal consequences of arrest for such behaviors what gain which is not evil do you expect from overpowering and imagining you control another human being
"big argument, wanted to work it out, asking others, leave me, wait on him to mature, talk to other people, come back in four years, pregnant, feel alone, handle this situation",Well as far as your boyfriend sounds like he has received advice from others that is not wise advice  Leaving is not the answer after a big argument as you mentioned  However this is not surprising to me based on his possible age and maturity level  Having a baby is a lifetime responsibility and there are very few who handle this or who realizes that it requires one to step their game up  This is something that he has to realize and be encouraged by his parents or a mature adult to do  Hopefully someone who has better wise advice will talk to him and he will listenAs for you  how do you handle this situation is your questionyou do what you have to do to prepare for your baby with or without him  A lot can happen in four years and you dont have time are not required and cant wait to see what will happen with him  You have a LIFE to prepare for  to feed to protect and to love  Can you tell your baby to wait I dont want to deal with you now I need to mature I will be back to see you later Hope you will be fine  Nope   As I always say you are not alone because there is someone somewhere going through the same or similar thing  Develop healthy friendshipswhether with family friends or new people who may enter your life  Your support system will grow and life will go onwith or with him  Stay focus on you and your baby

"drug rehabilitation program, kicked out, using drugs, overdosed, found dead, accountability, counselors, therapists, halfway house, relapsed, legal case, failing to report",Im so sorry to hear of your loss  This sounds like a really difficult situation for the whole family  Since the answer to this question will depend a lot on the applicable state laws I would suggest talking with a local attorney  That being said I see two competing issues here  On the one side is the duty of confidentiality the counselors owed to your relative  On the other side is the duty the counselors had to act reasonably to protect your relative from harm  Generally there is not a requiremt for substance abuse treatment centers to notify family members if an adult client relapsesA local attorney will be able to provide more specific guidance on the legal obligtions and liabilities in this situation
"feel like, never fully meet, finish it, should have picked someone else, want nothing to do with me",It sounds like you have the perception that people are frequently disappointed in you wish you were different or someone else and ultimately reject you One question I would have for you is what is your evidence that people feel this way Is there anything in peoples words or behaviors that gives you this impression If your not sure it may be useful for you to try to notice what people say and do in response to you even though you perceive these attitudes within them Additionally working with a competent therapist may be a great way to get an answer to your question as well as developing ways to move forward with that answer and gain a sense of selfesteem and security in your relationshipsOne possibility that comes to mind of which there may be more is that as we grow up we often develop relational templates or sets of expectations about how people are and will relate to us which influence our experiences and behavior in relationships Sometimes the templates that we develop to stay connected growing up are not particularly adaptive for adult life and can hamper our selfesteem and capacity for comfortable intimacy as an adult You ask a great question here and one that can be very hard to see through given the difficulty of feeling that people think of you in this way and I hope that you will stay curious about this and consider working with a therapist who is trained to help you discover the answer
"PTSD, childhood events, traumas, panic attacks, nightmares, anger, depression, always on the edge, apathetic.",I will not say that you cant but I will say it will be much harder and the time may take much longer  Getting help and having someone to be there with you through the ups and down of PTSD makes the journey much easier
"feel like, born in the wrong body, should be a girl, not a boy, wanted to be a girl, what I was wasn't me, family is against transgender people, want to be me, happy, don't like my reflection, taking things, not prescribed, handled by a professional",Hi Do you have any opportunity to work with a therapist  It sounds like it might be really great to explore these feelings If you arent able to there are many awesome gender work books available that you could use to explore your thoughts and feelings Also  google ask a gender therapist  so many amazing video blogs to answer many questions  Good luck
"emotions, belittling, scolds, war, support, loved, horrible names, pushes buttons, call names",As frustrating and probably hurtful as your daughters comments sound theres also a message in them about how she genuinely feelsTo some degree your daughter and you may both feel similarly misunderstood by the otherDeveloping ways of listening and talking to one another to better understand how you each feel would probably help a lotOne major point to be aware is that the motherdaughter relationship dynamic because it is strong may slow the new dynamic of relating as two adultsWatch for your own tendency to expect your daughter to consider you as a parenting authority instead of considering her as a grown personThe same is true of your daughter  She may need to remind herself to talk to you as the adult she isHer needs from you are real they just need to be spoken to you in an adult way
"terminated counseling relationship, realizing, begin counseling again, voicemail message, returns calls in 24 hours, called on the weekend, want him to call me back, ignore me",Yes your former social worker should return your phone callIt is the professional ethic to do so and plain human decency to do soIf he doesnt there is nothing you can directly do about the fact of his ignoring youThere are formal complaints you can make which you can consider doingWhat matters most is receiving social work serviceStick with looking for another social worker who is willing to help youThe selfdoubts you mention may be worth examiningThey do not however excuse the social worker mishandling himself
"impress people, need to impress, hate me, feel this way",It is normal to seek others attention and noticing that some people would not be interested  After all we belong to a social environment where we constantly receive others feedback which at times validates us makes feel important and useful like we belong but also at times makes us feel isolated different and neglected which we could interpret as hateThe key is to be aware of what you think about what people think of you   Got it  This part can be tricky at times because what others think about us does not really affect us what really affects us is what we decide to believe internalize and make our reality  For example I could choose to ignore a persons comment about me or I could decide to focus on it all day analyze why they said that and what have I done to them to get to that conclusion  Eventually since we became so focused on that thought we may end up believing that what the other person said about us was true even if we did not agree to begin withSo how can we fix this  Awareness is the key  It is important that you understand the way you internalize external inputs like comments and to go through a process of discarding negative ones  It is also helpful to talk to your counselor about how you process feedback and validation so you learn to balance your positive traits from negatives and how that affects your relationships and selfesteemCómo me puede importar menos lo que la gente piensaSiempre siento la necesidad de impresionar a otros ya sea mi familia la gente de la escuela o extraños  Y sé que no importa lo que haga o cuanto haga siempre habrá personas que me odian  Por qué me siento asíEs común que busquemos la atención de otros y notemos que algunas personas no están interesadas  Después de todo pertenecemos a un ambiente social donde constantemente recibimos comentarios que a veces nos validan alagan y nos hacen sentir como parte importante y funcional de la sociedad pero en otros momentos nos hacen sentir aislados ignorados y diferentes lo cual lo pudiéramos interpretar como odioLa clave es estar conscientes de lo que pensamos que los otros piensan de nosotros Me sigues  Esta parte puede ser algo confusa porque lo que piensan otras personas de nosotros no nos afecta directamente lo que si nos afecta es lo que decidimos creer que otras personas piensan de nosotros y luego lo internalizamos y hacemos parte de nuestra vida  Por ejemplo  podemos decidir ignorar lo que una persona dice de nosotros o podemos decidir enfocarnos en ello todo el día analizando en detalle porque lo dijeron y que hemos hecho para hacer que ellos piensen así Eventualmente nos enfocamos tanto en ese pensamiento que terminamos creyendo que es verdad aun cuando originalmente no lo creíamos asíEntonces como lo arreglamos La clave es concientización  Es importante entender la manera en que internalizamos las opiniones de otros y que pasemos por un proceso de discriminación donde descartemos los comentarios negativos hasta que aprendamos a ignorarlos También ayudaría hablar con un Consejero sobre como internamente validas y descartas los comentarios y opiniones externas y como eso puede estar afectando tus relaciones y tu autoestima
"nightmares, being killed, wake up in a panic, crying, sweating, terrified, falling asleep, affecting daily life, make nightmares stop",Hello and thank you for your question Sleep problems including insomnia and even the nightmares that you are writing about are really common for people and so many people suffer from them Here are a few things to consider or to try 1 Have you changed or started taking any new medication lately Medications can certainly affect your sleep and some can even cause vivid or frightening dreams If you are taking a new medication talk to your provider about the nightmares this may be the cause 2 Stress can certainly increase our difficulty with sleep and can also begin to affect our dream states The dreams may not make much sense but then again even good dreams dont always make much sense Ask yourself do I have any new or renewed stressors in my life Work school relationships health all of these areas and many more are places where stress can hide out If this is the case talk with your provider or consider seeing a counselor who may be able to help 3 Something to consider is that once we start to have anxiety or stress about something we can begin to obsess about it My guess is that going to bed for sleep is no longer a pleasant thing for you Your stress and fear of what may happen when you sleep could start way before you actually go to bed This could increase your chances of having another bad dream Try relaxation techniques before going to bed If you have YouTube you can pull up Guided Meditation for Sleep exercises to help you relax There are many different ones to choose from You may also want to try deep breathing4 There are selfhelp ideas for managing bad nightmares If you Google search Nightmare Rescripting or Nightmare Exposure you may find some ideas and instructions on how to manage dreams I hope these ideas help Be well Robin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC
"worried, should be worried, do something, should do something",It can be tricky to figure out if a child is truly satisfied with his lack of friendships Parents can usually tell when their child is happy But kids who are unhappy may be masking disappointment perhaps acting out their feelings in an aggressive manner Others may internalize symptoms appearing sad or withdrawn A parent may learn a great deal by asking the teachers questions such as whether the child works with others on group projects or if he eats lunch alone A parent can also talk with the recess supervisor about what happens on the playground and whether your child stays on the sidelines of play unsure of how to join the group Therespectfully is a difference between kids who are shy but happy and kids who feel isolated because they do not know how to make friends Itis not necessarily that there is something wrong with that child but they will in fact need help and suggestions for breaking into a peer group Ask a child if there is someone he would like to have over to play If a mom or dad can make the play dates happen or if they hit on an activity the child truly enjoys the young person may begin to forge friendships on their own I encourage wellmeaning parents to choose words carefully Use phrases like Hey I noticed something or Let me help you be successful By showing respect parents should feel more comfortable nudging their children beyond their comfort zoneWhen to seek professional help When does isolation raise a red flag for longterm issues True personality disorders are not typically diagnosed until adulthood Still professional counseling should be considered if the antisocial behavior is causing the child significant distress perhaps keeping him from functioning in everyday activities Also parents should pay attention to how the childs social behavior changes over time such as social anxiety The vast majority of children who define quality time as time alone are perfectly happy healthy and normal If the child is able to nurture at least one friendship exhibiting what experts call social reciprocity then parents can relax and can cherish that child who enjoys the pleasure of his or her own company
"lost a friend to suicide, smoking marijuana, drinking more, cope with it, handle this better",First of all I am very sorry for your loss and I can understand the urge to drink and smoke to try and cope As Im sure you understand alcohol and marijuana may take the edge off of the pain in the short run but in the long run they may prevent you from being able to work through the thoughts and feelings that you have about the loss of your friend Grieving is a process that is unique to each individual and each relationship that may involve difficult confusing and even contradictory seeming thoughts and feelings and a competent therapist can help you work through this process It also may be useful for you to add other ways of coping such as taking care of yourself through exercise doing healthy activities that you love and spending time with people that you love Self care is often most difficult when we need it the most Thank you for reaching out

"emotions, symptoms, feeling better, back of my mind",Best answer that I can give to you is that some level of depersonalization is quite normal for everyone it will come and go throughout life kind of like being on a rollercoaster here it is then its gone not to return for quite some time like many things the more that you fixate on it the more stress it will cause you consider it part of life accept it and move on now if your having many many many of these episodes or have some auditory or visual hallucination or disturbances or emotional unbalancing that accompany it than that is definitely something to look at but for the most part nothing to worry about Hope this helpsC
"no friends, no hobbies, no interest, annoyed, tired, sleep, normal",Hello and thank you for your question It certainly sounds like you dont like how things are going Here are a few thoughts and ideas1 If you havent seen a primary care provider in a while you may want to There are health conditions that can affect your mood and energy levels even at your age It doesnt hurt to get checked out If they find the cause they may be able to treat it and improve the symptoms In addition most primary care providers are trained to be able to manage medication for patients who have mild moderate and sometimes severe depression So dont be surprised if your primary care doctor offers to put you on an antidepressant if they diagnose you with depression Medication is not the only way to treat depression but sometimes it is necessary depending on different factors2 You may want to consider counseling since it is another effective way to treat depression A counselor will help you explore the factors that may be leading to depressive symptoms in the first place This could include thoughts behaviors beliefs life experiences and other things 3 Finally to answer your question about whether these feelings are normal These symptoms could be the sign of an underlying general health or mental health condition It is important to remember that even if these symptoms are abnormal it doesnt mean that YOU are Millions of people struggle with depression So remember the symptoms are the problem not YOU Hope this helps Be wellRobin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC
"relationship, hurt, separated, difficult divorce, taking it hard, end relationship, let go",Hello and thank you for your question Boy ending relationships is tough isnt it Sometimes its tough even when we are 100 sure that it is the right thing to doI am going to give you some of my thoughts and hopefully some colleagues will add some others One of the things that I want to point out is that letting go is not really a thing In other words its not really something you can reach out and grab Its more of a process This is good news because you dont necessarily have to be at the end of the process to end an unhealthy relationship We just have to accept that there will be feelings that come up even after the relationship is over For example someone can end an unhealthy relationship today but then be reminded of the good times on what would have been their anniversary This could make the person very sad They may even regret ending the relationship for a little while It would important then for the person to remind themselves why the relationship needed to end and that they are healthier because of it This is relevant for you Its hard to walk away from a relationship We fear all kinds of things including being single Sometimes its helpful to compare what you are getting out of the relationship to what you want from a relationship Its helpful to be honest about what we have given up for an unhealthy relationship Its fine to admit uncertainly about ending things Its okay to be afraid Its okay to have moments of doubt and sadness along with a dash of guilt And even with all of that someone can still leave if it is the healthiest thing for them They can have sadness later on and still not go backIt sounds like you are feeling responsible for making sure he is okay because of this divorce The truth is that there is not necessarily a perfect time to end any relationship There would be no guarantee that he would be doing any better after the divorce Sometimes NOT making decisions stresses us out A LOT more than making a decision and living with the consequences both good and bad You may be at that crossroads Be wellRobin J Landwehr DBH LPC NCC
"nasty, mean, frustrated, angry, guilty, cope",Yes certainly your moms difficulty in having meaningful conversations with people results from the Alzheimers disease process which weakens her brain functionFeeling a sense of guilt in relation to a parent is pretty common for everyoneThis is because as little kids and babies we had a strong reliance on a parent and believing every word they sad and wishing to follow each action they ask or demand was for the benefit of our own survivalOne way of coping with your feeling of guilt is to examine itAsk what it is youre feeling guilty aboutChances are that your sense of guilt is less due to what youre currently saying or doing to help your momVery likely your guilt feeling is awakening the sense of obligation that you and all of us feel toward a parent simply because parents seem to have unquestionable power when we are very youngAfter all youre thoughtful enough to write a question so chances are great that youre already actively involved in caring for your mom
"Alzheimer's, lost intellectual abilities, disappointment, frustration, ignore opinions, wishes",Good observation on your part to distinguish that your feelings in relation to your mom are not necessarily connected to the way she handles her part of the relation toward youHas your mom usually ignored your opinions and wishes in relating to youIf prior to the onset of Alzheimers she never examined her way of relating to you and if both of you have never had an open conversation about your sense of feeling hurt by her attitudes and manner with you then the relationship between you and your mom will change in ways other than rational dialogueShe may continue ignoring or overlooking your wishes because shes been stuck in this attitude for most of your lifeThe good news for you about this is realizing that who you are and your way of relating to your mom has very little to do with the way she relates to youThis is a more profound disappointment because it shows that her disconnect from you has been for longer than when the Alzheimers beganYou can however feel a little more free knowing that youre not deserving of being ignored
"diagnosed type one diabetic, tough time dealing, attachment issue, angry, demands, mother moved, driving us crazy",There are many possible answers here It could be that she misses friends that she felt safe in the other house emotionally safe and comfortable or dozens of other things Will she talk about it when shes not mad You mentioned that she has an attachment issue It could also be that she was attached to the house Its not the same as being attached to a person but possessions and safe places certainly mean a lot
"love of my life, left me, never looked back, broke my heart, miss her, cant seem to get over, heartbroken",I recognize that you say you are missing being with the love of your life At the same time I dont understand whether you are able to see your son Im curious as to the relationship dynamic between you and your sons motherWhen you say that she never looked back I imagine you are conveying that getting back together is not something that she is interested inI would suggest that you talk with a therapist and your local area so that you have the ability to discuss the loss of this person who you love so much Most people think of grief related to the loss of someone who has died But it also applies to people who have a significant loss whether that is a relationship a job or any number of other thingsIn the meantime try finding something about yourself that you value and can focus on
"separated, asked about her contact, male friend, kicked me out, move back, divorce, changed her mind, other guy, factor, not my business",Divorce is a serious life altering decisionIt is best to decide any serious matter through reflection and discussionStart by knowing what you want from the marriage and why you are willing to move in or out of your own house because your wife tells you to do thisEach of you would benefit from more clarity of what you expect and would like from each otherDoes your wife want a boyfriend in addition to the marriage to youIs she willing to drop the male contactDoes she care how you feel about her contact with the other guyYou need answers and knowledge about the definition of your marriageSince there are many areas to open all of which are filled with emotion including pain if youre not able to make satisfactory progress then a licensed couples therapist may be useful to you and your partner
"losing a comb, furious, throwing things, problem",Anyone who asks whether or not they have a problem usually feels at least partly that they do have a problemYour answer to the question is what mattersSince you already understand that your reaction is overstated to the events which trigger them the reactions youre having are more than likely anger that is leftover from past events either in the near or distant pastBe aware consider reflect on  how you usually handle feeling angry  Based on your description here it is quite likely that the anger you show toward what you call little things reflect anger at much bigger matters that are uncomfortable and not easy to understandKnowing more about the more significant matters causing frustration for you may very likely decrease reacting angrily toward smaller matters
"arguing, every night, same thing, tells me, out of state, gone, get back, do not get along",Its ultimately your decision whether or not you go to see your mother Im not sure whether talking with her on the phone or through some videoconferencing application such as Skype would be something you could do in the meantime until you sort out what you want to doSome things I wonder areWhat makes the two of them not get alongWhat makes him feel threatened or on edge if you visit your mother without him What does he think will happenWhat is he getting out of trying to choose for youWhat is he so afraid ofIf you decide to talk about these things with your boyfriend try to do the followingConsider using questions that start with the words who what where when and not why The word why can be really difficult for some people to answer because the word itself triggers an emotional reactionTry to ask him if the two of you can discuss this in a way that you can just ask more questions about what he is experiencing If you can listen without being defensive about what you think and feel you may understand more about where you boyfriend is coming fromRemember that understanding what he means does not mean that you have to agree with what he is sayingMaybe he would be willing to listen to what you are experiencing and ask questions about that as you did for him It would be good to do this in a way similar to what an investigative reporter would do and asking questions that cannot be answered in a yes or no format and require more informationIm sure this is putting you in a very tough place If you would like to talk to someone more directly about the details consider seeing a local mental health professional
"angry, wonderful, depressed, hopeless",This is actually more common then we often realize and actually understandable as he has gone through a trauma an unresolved existential crisis  He was taken care of by others and now is again left alone with his own internal and rather horrific inner struggleIn my work with CCT or Contextual Conceptual Therapy see wwwsuicidetherapycom I have learned how trapped suicidal people are in their own isolation also called a mysterious isolation a form of self protection which cuts the off from their Self or spirit  And unless they address this message from their soul accompany a guide on a journey to discover their own missing information that is to recognize how their own uncomforted emotional pain has resulted in a coping stategy which has effectively cut themselves off from their own beauty their Self and their ability to receive love from themselves and others Their attempt to kill themselves is a cry from their soul or spirit that they cannot live the life they are living any longer  They take this literally and try to end their life when in fact what their soul or spirit is saying is they need to begin to live the life they came here to live
"therapists, classify, personality, characteristics, decide, client, point of view",Thats a great question There is such a wide range of ways to define personality that it is difficult to identify specific characteristics that are used to identify personality typesThat being said some clinicians will use standardized tests or assessments to assess a clients type of personality While these tests cant tell us everything about a person they can help us understand where we are within larger groups of different personality stylesSome counselors will also use a diagnostic tool like the DSM or ICD to help a client understand a diagnosis that is related to a personality disorder
"toxic relationship, emotional abuse, verbal abuse, feel like, cant be happy, get away",Im glad you recognize your own best interest and that your life will be much better without verbal and emotional abuseOne of the terrible results of being abused in a relationship which is expected to be loving safe and supportive is that the one who is being abused starts to question their own judgement rights opinions overall way of thinkingThis happens because partners who are intimately involved with one another are very meaningful  Regardless of how irrational wrong mean selfish intimidating thoughtless a partner is to the other the person on the receiving side gradually starts questioning whether they are wrong for not accepting these sorts of interactionsStick with what your own intuition tells youThere is a part within each of us which knows the truth of what is going onLeaving a relationship is always difficult to some degree  People are in familiar patterns of daily behavior no one wants to suddenly be alone even if this only means showing up as a physical body not as a truly loving partner no one wants to start telling others about a breakup answer questions about it feel blamed worry what others thinkThese are secondary matters to following the truth in your own heartListen to yourself about leaving this guy Your inner self does not lie to you
"empathize, physical pain, life difficult, hyper empathy disorder, new disorder, information, going on",The world needs more people lately who have such a high degree of empathy which you describe in yourselfIf it feels a little burdensome then look to balance what is too much with its opposite  Since youre giving a lot of empathy maybe youd like receiving a lot of empathyIn the situation you describe when you start empathizing with others real or cartoon ask yourself whether youve felt empathy coming in your direction latelyOften people give to others what they feel within themselves is missingThe emotional brain reasons that if I give you my support say then at least I will feel half of what being supported is likeObviously the wish to receive more empathy cannot be fulfilled by you directly  Empathy is delivered by someone who is willing to offer itReflect on whether you are allowing those who are in your world to know when you would like to receive their empathyIs it possible you keep your feelings to yourself and present as though you are able to handle a great deal more than youd like to handle without anyones kindness to support youBeing open to others about your own inner thoughts and feelings is much more difficult than it soundsIt sounds easy to just tell someone how you feelSometimes the first step is the most difficult of accessing how you feelStart with knowing the amount of empathy youd like from others and what stops you from askingAlso about your diagnosis and the lack of  studies and lists and formulas  Each person is unique the instructions and guidelines dont necessarily mean very much  Often having a diagnosis makes a person feel weak stigmatized incompetent Forget the diagnosis and concentrate on what you need to do differently in order to feel betterThe answers are inside you not inside a book or website
"anxiety, terrified, anxiety attack, new, travel, far away, job, family, need",Anxiety can cause such a feeling of discomfort in our bodies that it can seem unbearable The concern that I can hear in what you have written is that the thought of having some anxiety has now left you uncomfortable with any anxiety at all  and that can become a problem indeed As opposed to thinking about your anxiety as something much bigger than you it could be helpful to start breaking it down What are the things specifically that cause you anxiety about this new job Is it being away from your family If so why Once you start breaking down what causes you to feel anxiety into smaller mouthfuls then we are far better able to understand what has led to discomfort and start to problem solve the issue
"anger, guilty, over drinking, cheating, under the influence, problem",The short answer is yes  if you feel really guilty after a night of drinking then you probably have a problem What you could do is visit this website by the National Institutes of Health httprethinkingdrinkingniaaanihgovHowmuchistoomuch  There you will find information on how many drinks is too much and the general answer for women is more than seven drinks in a week There is also a quiz you can take anonymously that will help you determine if your drinking is a problem The good news is that you can get help for substance abuse through counseling selfhelp programs or alcoholics anonymous
"emotions, insecurity, deception, embarrassment, self-consciousness, body image, social anxiety",I get how you feel you wish your body looked different and youre embarrassed that you tried to make it look different and people may notice You dont say how old you are Its likely that if you are young your body will change as you mature but in general were given the bodies were given and Im glad to see that there may be a desire in you to accept your body the way it is You seem to want to stop disguising it Bodies come in all shapes and sizes and every woman knows how it feels to struggle with accepting what hers looks like Many men go through this as well although women are more often targeted with cultural messages about how were supposed to look Young people often believe that others are noticing and judging them In fact other people are far more preoccupied with who might be judging them than whatevers going on with you I suggest you wear whatever bra you want to wear and if someone is rude enough to comment on it you can ignore them and talk about the weather or the latest pop song that you love and theyll get the hint But my bet is they wont even notice
"upset, panicked, shocked, mad, wrong with me",The good news is your awareness that being violent to animals feels out of character for you   Im glad you have awareness and Im glad you are not at ease with killing frogsFairly likely that you were acting out aggressively toward the frog feelings of being on the receiving side of similar type of violenceBasically you did unto the frog what someone has or to you feels like has been done to youUse your surprising finding of how strong your anger and most likely inward pain   Reflect on your closest relationships and how these people treat you   It is possible you feel more hurt by someone who is close to you than you ever realizedStabbing innocent frogs is wrong  It is understandable as a way to show you how much inner pain you probably haveIt is also wrong that someone close to you hurt youThe direction to go is to recognize your pain and then decide how to go about changing what is possible on your side of that or those relationships
"female friend, crazy, stop talking, answer the phone, suspicious, girlfriend, believe, understand",We women really do tend to struggle with the comparison game And Hollywood culture hasnt helped with romantic comedies and song lyrics telling us that when a man appears evasive theres something to worry about Its been my clinical experience though that most women value transparency and security in their relationships So you might try sharing a little bit more about your history with this woman For exampleWhere did you meet herHow long were you friends before you decided to call it quits Why dont you want to be friends with her ie what do you mean by kind of crazy I promise this tends to matter to womenWere you ever intimately involved with or even attracted to herIf your girlfriend can truly see that you view her as the filet mignon to the other womans hamburger and that she is your favorite person on the planet and has NOTHING to worry about she may start to come aroundNow IF shes more concerned that you might be taking this womans calls behind your back while Im not typically a huge fan of sharing passwords or phone records you might print them off and highlight this females number and show your girlfriend that you absolutely are telling the truthAnd if you really want to step it up I would be intentional about doing all the little things that you know your girlfriend loves that helped make her fall in love with you in the first place eg little love notes for her to find or sweet text messages buy a rose or her favorite flower have her car detailed do the laundrydate nightsyou get the idea  Bottom line  show your girlfriend why out of all the women on the planet that you could be with you CHOSE HER  And would continue to do so all over again  AND why you love HER as a person  This will help her trust what youre saying Best of luck to you  Tamara Powell LMHC
"married for 11 years, drifted far apart, coexist together, personal interest, emotional invested, feel very alone, uncared for, reconnected",Im sorry for how youre feeling in your marriage lately  Are you and your husband able to talk directly about your feelings  The way two people connect is usually by talking with each other to understand what each one cares about and thinksYour current emotional suffering is the natural result of being married to someone who shows no interest in doing thisIf your husband wants to start talking with you then there is a chance the two of you can reconnect  If he doesnt want to participate in the relationship with you then start to think if its possible and for how long to get emotional support from friends and family who do care for youAlso a question for the future is to understand what the value of your marriage is to you besides having a connection to your husband
"insecurities, overreacting, triggering, bad past relationships, trust, partner, emotions, symptoms, situations",Two paths are possibleYoure not overreacting and instead are genuinely sensing that something feels unsettled within your girlfriendYou are overreacting because you have difficulty accepting how safe and loving your relationship is with this personThe only way to find out is to start conversations with your girlfriend on how you feelThis will allow new light to open an answer as to the truthOnce you know what truly is going on between the two of you your selftrust naturally will grow stronger Selftrust will give you an accurate read of what and whom you are able to safely trust
"intense mood swings, high mood, irritated by other people, blame other people, tendencies, not working out",Teenagers are prone to mood swings due to developmental and hormonal changes that are rapidly and intensely occurring in your body and mind  so some of this happens to many people in your stage of development You are not at all aloneYouve taken the first and very important step in regulating your moods by just identifying that you are having these intense changes instead of being completely submerged in them and unaware The more you are able to be a witness to your emotions and thoughts the more you can learn to manage them Your question offers several clues for strategies that you can try  for example identify the warning signs for becoming irritated and plan a response such as taking a deep breath informing the person you are becoming irritated and need some space or find a distraction temporarily like listening to music or going for a walk Since you are aware of blaming others for things not working out you can proactively make a personal commitment to taking ownership or personal responsibility by just thinking about it and practicing thoughts such as I am responsible for my efforts and Blame is not helpful for anyone and other thoughts that you believe and can repeat related to this insight When you practice thinking more rational healthy thoughts you are actually rewiring your brain so practice is key
"mother running my life, almost 30 years old, move out, live my own life, relationship, making my own decisions, worry, talk to someone",ABSOLUTELY  Having someone whos outside the situation and even more so with knowledge and experience in human behavior and relationship dynamics such as a counselor can do wonders in helping us feel less alone in frustrating situations like the one youre currently stuck in with your mother  A professional can also assist you in finding some assertiveness techniques communication strategies and coping skills to help you find your voice and stand your ground in a way that feels most authentic to youIn a healthy parentchild dynamic there comes a normal developmental shift when as the child reaches each new stage of maturity and responsibility the parent backs off to provide a more supportive role instead of directive role  We call this redefining relationships  We also do it with our friendships and colleagues here and there over time as needed Its absolutely vital Sounds like your mom may have missed that memo Like many parents she may feel your behavior and choices is a direct reflection of her  Or that her role as your mother allows her greater latitude than it should  Or like many other people in general that her way is the ONLY way  Regardless this is YOUR life  And as far as we know its not a dress rehearsal  You certainly dont want to wake up some 50 years from now regretful or resentful That being said there are certainly ways to show her love and respect while doing what makes you happy I would encourage you to Google therapists near you whose bios resonate with you and what youre looking for and start on a the journey towards a new chapter of freedom and hopefully a deeper more satisfying motherdaughter relationship for both of youWarmest regardsTamara Powell LMHC
"ruining my life, decisions, serious changes, cant seem, force myself, change",In general the reason people arent able to change is because the person feels a sense of fear to changeWhat the roots are of this fear are usually easiest to identify by talking with someone whom you trust and feel safe to talk about your inner thoughts and emotionsIf you havent got someone like this in your life which is common then shop around for a therapist because a therapist is someone who is professionally trained to listen in a way which helps someone know more about who they areBe patient with yourself too  Change sometimes feels much scarier and is more complex than simple compared with whatever you would like to change
"refuses to talk, remembering things from the past, blames me, hates me, should just let, live with her dad, fix things, see her every other weekend",Sorry to hear about your high degree of stressHow old is your daughterWho abused yours daughterThe answers make a difference to your decisionObviously if the father was the abuser then unless your ex demonstrates to you and you believe he will not abuse her your daughter should stay with youIf someone other than the father was the abuser and the father has a good relationship with your daughter then it is possible that the time away from your household will give each of you time away from arguing with one anotherWhat does your daughter tell you she wantsHer wishes must be considered tooRelationships can be fixed   Sometimes being apart helps this process because the two people each have time to reflect more deeply on what they value about the other
"separated, doesn't want to talk, doesn't love me, anything to get him back, hope",There is always hope So dont give up on hopeHowever you knew I would say that there is a lot work ahead of youYou need to see someone to talk things outGet some space between you and your husband Dont chase and please dont stalk himDo some deep searching as to why he left and what part you had to cause the splitYou cant change him but you are in control of your own changeWith the help of a professional counselor you can get help and direction where you need to change
"affection, push away, kiss, hug, touch, birth control, sex drive, love, emotions",Are you sure it is only the birth control pills which has changed your sex driveMy guess would be that possibly due to the hormonal changes of the pill your own awareness and understanding of yourself in this relationship is what is actually changingBirth control pills control ovulation   They dont directly prevent people from all desire to express affectionAllow yourself some time to reflect on how you feel toward your BF   It is possible the birth control pills triggered a change in your attitude toward himAnd maybe independent of the pill maybe you just are done with the relationship
"accusing of cheating, disrespectful behavior, offended, accused of cheating, misunderstanding, relationship issues, lack of trust, communication problems",Hello That must be very frustrating for you to feel that you to be reminded of constant wrongdoing in your relationship especially when you feel that your wife does not admit to any fault This could lead you to feel inadequate in the relationship that can harm your relationship in the longterm Based on what you are reporting and without knowing your wifes side of the story I would say that you are raising 3 different concerns One is that there seems to be some concern of infidelity from your wife that you feel is not justified It may bear clarifying how each of you define infidelity Currently there is no uniform definition of infidelity because it can emcompass a hookup chatroom texting extensive phone calls to a female friend viewing pornography a massage with happy ending physical intercourse or intimate emotional sharing Depending on whether any of these circumstances have occured you may need to reflect whether there is any truth to what she may be accusing you of and for you to share with her your reasons for engaging in these activities If there is no truth to it then my clinical intuition is that she may be accusing you of infidelity as a way of saying I feel you distancing from me In other words its not so much about whether you are actually unfaithful but a statement of how she feels as she witnesses your distancing from her Often times accusing a partner of cheating is likened to a cry or a yearning for closeness If so what you want to do is to reflect to her that perhaps she is saying that you are unfaithful because she senses that you are moving away from her emotionally If this is true you may wish to share with her why you are pulling away and then discuss the kind of support you may need to feel closer to her again Otherwise if the focus becomes about who is right and who is wrong the conversation will never touch at both of your core emotional needs The second issue touches upon how to interpret calling someone a sweetheart The term has been loosely used in a variety of contexts to mean youre so sweet and kind my dear or in a flirtatious manner to mean sweetie The intention behind the use is known only to the speaker You may want to reflect in what context you meant to use the term and share it with your wife If your wife overheard the comment not knowing your intentions or context it is possible that she may have misinterpreted what you have said  If she finds the term disrespectful it may be her way of expressing I want to be the important person in your life and if you call someone else a sweetheart it means that I am not valued as much Therefore arguing about who has the right or wrong interpretation may be missing the mark Rather the issue is about how do you wish to treat or show consideration of each others feelings You may wish to explore how do you show her that you value her and that she is important to you Is saying sweetheart to another woman conducive to that or is it sending mixed messages to your wife That said if you have expressed and shown her that she is important to you on many occasions with open discussions and by understanding accomodating and prioritizing her needs then her actions may be a reflection of her personal insecurities She may need to speak to a therapist about her feelings and her fearsThe last issue you raised concerns your wife never admitting shes wrong Indeed that must be frustrating for you to hear often that you are doing something wrong In the absence of her admitting to any faults it could seem like you are the one with the problem Unfortunately blaming invites defensiveness and a withdrawn behavior because most people who feel blamed do not feel good about themselves and wishes to distance themselves from the person who is making them feel unhappy This pattern can also trigger the partners insecurity as they witnesses the distancing which could make them angrier and more accusatory  creating a vicious cycle Finding a healthy way of reaching out when your partner is in turmoil to help calm her emotions and being able to speak about your own feelings and needs is at the heart of a very secure attachment This kind of conversation can be guided by an experienced professional to help both of you to express your feelings and needs in a safe and secure way to foster a secure bonding We sometimes take for granted the simple expression of Im sorry However it requires a certain comfort with being vulnerable to express that In my practice when a client tells me that his or her partner never says Im sorry I am often observing the first partner to see if they are able to express vulnerability If neither of them express it then it makes sense to me because why would one risk being vulnerable and then getting hurt if they open up if the other partner doesnt do it These insights in therapy can sometimes lead to a different relationship building conversation which can help couples to to feel safer with each other rather than blaming and alientating For

"first threesome, drinking, feeling better, craving more, empty feeling, feeling this way",Hello and thank you for your question Nervousness when doing something new especially something sexual that can feel so personal is very common Indeed despite the fact that nervousness can be uncomfortable it is also part of the excitement of trying something new Many people who engage in open polyamorous andor othertype relationships will tell you that difficult feelings such as jealousy and anger do show up sometimes This doesnt prove that there is something wrong with the relationship it just shows that you retain normal human emotions while in one And many people who are in polyamorous relationships have written about the work it sometimes takes to make such relationships work Of course all relationships take work so polyamorous and other types of relationships are simply not an exception There could be several reasons why you are feeling the way you do One reason could be that you are simply not as comfortable with the idea as you think you are Some time and good communication with your husband may help you with this Another reason this may be bothering you is because on some level you are aware of the messages society gives us about marriages They are supposed to be monogamous heterosexual etc etc Just because you may not agree with these beliefs doesnt mean that you havent been influenced by them We all have Another reason this may be upsetting you is because it may feel a little frightening Perhaps there are a lot of What ifs going on in your mind When you get the empty feeling it may be helpful to try to really nail down the emotions that are attached to that feeling One thing that I do think is very important is that you communicate these feelings to your husband It may even be a good idea to talk about expectations or ground rules if you will It is important that you are both on the same page about what this is and why you are doing it If you continue to struggle I suggest finding a counselor who has experience in sex and sexuality  I wish you wellRobin J Landwehr DBH LPCC NCC
"love, complicated, afraid, long distance, military, relationship going",Hello You are asking a very good question about how to sustain a longdistance relationship Although maintaining a longdistance relationship has its challenges with the proper communication commitment and understanding many longdistance couples are able to thrive and maintain a close connection Without knowing more about the complicated nature of your relationship I wonder whether your boyfriend has given you reason not to trust him that makes afraid that he will find someone else Has he cheated on you in the past and has shown romantic interest to another person that made you fear losing him  Or is your thought just a fear but not based on evidence Knowing that distinction is important because if it is the latter you may benefit from refocusing on the wonderful qualities about your partner that makes you feel good about him and the relationship rather than focusing on the unknown or uncertainty of the future The more you focus on what if situations the more you may feel anxious about a reality that is not accurate and make you act in ways that are insecure However if there is reason for you to question his fidelity you may have to speak to your boyfriend about how to build trust in the context of a longdistance relationship To help the conversation you may need to consider what you may need to experience or receive as support to feel safe in the relationship to build trust Is that you wish him to contact you regularly or to include you more in his life or to make a clear commitment For many of my clients in my private practice that may include talking to their partner often and using a variety of modalities including text phone and Skype Its hard to believe in a relationship when you never talk to your partner and its hard to build a relationship when you dont know whats going on in your partners life Other times it is Making sure they talk often to their longdistance partner so that they can participate in each others lives and to feel their presence Regular communication understanding and caring is the key to sustaining any relationship but this is especially true for longdistance ones Dr Virginia ChowwwwPsychologyResourceca
"live with my mom, dad gets angry, makes me feel, everything is my fault, talk to my mom, dad tells me, scared, wrong decision, dad will hate me, tell him, want to live with my mom",There is a lot of information that needs to be filled in first So what the custody arrangement Does your dad have full custody Is the custody shared What does your mom think about the situation Is she willing to go to bat for youWhat is your age Usually you have the right to choose based on age requirements set by the stateLegally you cant be kept away from your mom unless there is some legal complications that prevent itIs your father abusive and should you seek protectionMany details need to be filled inYou can seek counseling without your parents approving or knowing depending on your ageFind counseling through school or local agenciesYou have rights and one of those is the right to choose
"feel alone, many people around, just listen, dont understand, all be okay, dont listen, here for me, feel alone",You ask a very deep and sensitive question which reflects good selfawarenessIt is possible you are a more sensitive and aware person than the people whom you describe as listening and not really hearing youNot everyone has the same capacity or willingness to pay careful attention to what is going on in lifeMaybe for right now until you are able to find in person friends whom youre able to feel hear you the way youd like to be heard find online forums and groups of likeminded peopleIf you google a topic which you wish your friends would be better at understanding there will be scores of groups including google groups which come upYoure not alone in the sense that there are definitely people on this earth who are sensitive caring and willing to talk and understand others
"long distance relationship, saw his phone, texts the most, female coworker, approach this situation, ask him about it",If youd like to ask a question then go ahead and askBoyfriendgirlfriend is a close relationship and it is usually understood as an exclusive relationship  Youre definitely entitled to know if your wishes to not have him texting another woman are being respectedOften people are afraid to ask because they fear the truth will hurt themIn the short term this is definitely trueIn the long term knowing you are getting what you want and at the very least stating your expectations to your boyfriend will clarify for him what is meaningful in your relationship
"obsessing, terrible breakup, constant reminder, move on",Let yourself know what you feel   There is no timetable or known length of how much time a particular person requires in order to feel that the dissolved relationship is behind themProbably the more you allow yourself to acknowledge your sadness from seeing the reminders the sooner you will feel fresh and new again
"scary thoughts, scare myself, something bad, going to happen, cant get it out, stop these thoughts",Scary thoughts can feel overwhelming at times as well as feeling quite real I want to acknowledge how scary they can feel but there is hope and new skills you can learn to work with these types of thoughts The first step in working with scary or negative thoughts is to acknowledge that they are just thoughts and we can choose to follow the scary thought streams or work with cutting them off or ignoring them I also realize that might seem really hard to do but heres a good way to think about the brain and how thought patterns work Thoughts arise in the mind all the time our brain is a thought machine Many thoughts drift by like clouds and we dont pay any attention while other thoughts arise and they trigger us in a particulate way ie scary angry happy sad and when those thoughts arise we can chose to pay more attention to the thought which can lead us down that particulate thought stream that will lead to fear and anxiety So how do we work or stop those scary thought streams One new skill to implement comes from the work of Rick Hansen he wrote the book Buddhas Brain he teaches that we need to give more energy and attention to the positive thoughts or positive memories we hold in our mind and pay less attention to the negative thoughts Hansen asks us to imagine the brain this way the brain is like Velcro with negative thoughts and like teflon when it comes to positive thoughts There are reasons that our brain works this way but I dont have time to go into all of that in this response So its just important to remember we have to work at positive thinking actually pausing throughout the day to focus on positive feelings and memories  this will help the mind reinforce positive thought streams and help reduce negative thought streams over time If a scary thought arises try to replace it with a happy experience for at least a couple of moments and see if that helps reduce the negative charge connected with that scary thought
"sick and tired, anxiety attacks, suicidal thoughts, self-harm, affected, anxiety, therapist not available, handle",I am so sorry to hear you are going through this Divorce can be so disruptive in a childs lifeId really need a lot more information about your situation before Id feel comfortable offering any advice or suggestions There are so many variables and not knowing the whole story any advice could possibly make your situation worseI do see some positives though One you say you have a therapist Thats great I hope youre able to talk to them about this soon Still they cant give you legal advice and a lot of this situation may be dictated by the law What your therapist can help with though is dealing with whatever situation you have to follow by law If you cant change the situation you at least need to learn how to cope with it better Two youre 17 When youre 18 youre legally an adult and will not be bound by any custody rules or visitation plans in place Honestly teenagers usually have a lot of say with the courts in custody arrangements Since you didnt specify more on the situation I have no idea what your specific situation is Were your parents ever married Are they separated or divorced Was there ever a court hearing for custody Not all couples have an official court order arrangement All families are different too Was there abuse between your parents Towards you by one of them Does either of them have addiction issues major health or mental health issues or anything like that You mentioned that you want to live with your mom but didnt say why Are you afraid to tell your dad you want to stay with your mom Is mom the lenient and fun parent while dad is the more strict one or is there something else going on This isnt a decision that should be placed entirely on you and it also isnt a decision that anyone else needs to make on your behalf without your input But advice on what to do needs to come from the people who know more about your situation so they can help recommend the best thing for you Whatever you do hang in there 18 will be here before you know it Focus on that Freedom College Plan for your future that YOU control and focus on making it the best it can be Do not let the anxiety and depression cloud your thoughts and make you do something irreversible
"depressed, quit drinking, move, help, stay",Youre probably not going to like my answerYour question says a lot about what YOU want rather than what she wants or what may be best for her Sometimes whats best for a person is the hardest thing to do and may be completely opposite of what YOU wantAddictions dont happen in a vacuum If youve had any experience with addicts at all then Im sure youve heard the term enabler A lot of the times when people think theyre helping theyre actually enabling the addict to continue their selfdestructive behavior Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations but especially with addictions Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to usedrink continuing to do so or relapsing back into itYou said she recently quit You said she is depressed She wants to move When a person receives counseling for addictions they are encouraged to make changes like this They need to break the habit and this means removing people from their lives at times It means moving to new locations Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed Not only that but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they usedrink in the first place and not only break the physical addiction to it but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthyDont pressure her to stay Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do If she stays the decision needs to be hers and hers alone It doesnt need to be made under pressure That will only lead to resentment Support her but dont try to change her or make her do anything especially for selfish reasons Let her go It sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now It wouldnt be a bad idea for you to do the same
"feel like shit, worthless, depressed, want to move out, lose it",Are you old enough to move out Then by all means whats stopping youIf not is it possible for you to move in with another family memberIf youre a minor CPS may need to step in They often do in cases of abuse Your safety is the number one priorityIts difficult to offer advice without knowing more about your situation But I can say this Dont let other people define your self worth You can choose NOT to allow him to make you feel anything It really is that simple By looking at it as a choice you make you will be empowered to take control over your emotions and learn to feel better about yourself because your selfworth will no longer be defined by what someone else says about you or how they treat youLet me say that again in a different way Your selfworth is NOT defined by someone else The way he treats you is a reflection of who he is as a person  not you Dont take ownership of that I understand that if you are a minor setting healthy boundaries and refusing to accept this kind of treatment can be difficult Reach out to others for help But if you are 18 and over there is absolutely no excuse for you to be there having to put up with maltreatment Put up some boundaries and create the distance needed to protect yourself emotionally You owe it to yourself and deserve to live a healthy happy life Anyone who tells you otherwise is wrong

"love, girlfriend, erection, thinking, seeing, tried, sex, couldnt get, long time ago, happening, what can I do",Sexual desire seems to be straightforward  I like someone and I become aroused at the thoughts of being intimate with them  but that idea does not always take into account other factors Stress can have a huge effect on our body and how it performs  When we are overstressed for example we often find ourselves ill at the same time  Can you think of any part of your world that may be causing you some additional stress Additionally focusing on your erection may also be increasing the level of stress you feel about being intimate which could also effect your ability to get and maintain an erection  While this may seem counter intuitive it makes sense in the word of stressFinally its never a bad idea to follow up with your doctor as well You did not mention your age or sexual history outside of this relationship but it is always a good idea to check in with medical staff to make sure there is nothing physically responsible for changes in our body as well
"winter, sad, weather, fight",Seasonal Affective Disorder SAD is a term that reflects how many people are affected by the changing seasons especially fall to winter  Everyone suffers with some form of this lessened activity levels increased isolation etc while some find that this time of year can put them into a deeper depression If you have noticed that this happens frequently there are some ways you can definitely help yourself going forward1 Attend therapy to learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood  Its important to stay within the therapy until you feel you have mastered these tools 2 Push yourself to interact more with your social groups and other positive activities Its easy to go out and spend the day outside in the summer months when the temperature is warm and the sun shines for long periods of the day but it seems harder to find fun ways to spend your time when the temperature drops and darkness comes on so quickly  Perhaps winter time could become the time of year where you and your friends have weekly board game nights complete with hot chocolate and a fire3 You may want to consider the purchase of a SAD Light  These are lights that expose you to additional ultra violet light to increase the vitamin D in our bodies as well as the release of growth hormone which releases when we wake up There are mixed reviews of these products however and they can be expensive

"anxiety, rough childhood, hitting head, not realize, change behavior, help myself",The best way to handle anxiety of this level is with a combination of appropriate medication given to you by a medical doctor and therapy to help you understand the thoughts feelings and behaviors that are causing the anxiety  This is not something that anyone should just white knuckle and try to get through on their own with no help  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety  This takes a therapist trained in CBT You will learn to recognize when and why you perform the behavior of hitting your head help you deal with the underlying cause of this and replace the behavior with a more positive behavior Youll learn coping skillsYou mention having a rough childhood Anyone who has experienced trauma like this especially longterm ongoing trauma from abuse of any kind definitely does not need exposure therapy which is what is recommended for phobias You need a therapist trained specifically in trauma informed therapyYou are on the right path by recognizing there is an issue and what it is Good luck with your healing journey
"feelings, fell in love, difficult, move on, showed me feelings, genuine love, logically, need to be without him, conditions surrounding our love, wrong, discuss, move on",Its difficult to move on and let go especially when youve experienced things for the first time with someone or feelings youve never felt before as you saidI like the fact that you are looking at your situation logically  Feelings can take time to fade but you seem to understand even if it is subconsciously that its the feelings he stirred up in you that are keeping you tied to him not necessarily the person himself Realize that you can and will experience those feelings again with another person  the RIGHT person Dont hold onto someone who is wrong for you just because of something like this Youre wanting those feelings and wanting a relationship  but with him necessarily Or with anybody You said you dont want to be without your love for him  not you dont want to be without him In fact you said you know you need to be without him It seems like its the LOVE that you cant let go of and the feelings Not the person Trust me you will find that again Take some time to let this fade Dont try to force him or anyone else into a role that is meant for someone else Cherish the memories and the experiences you had Sounds like its been a valuable learning and growth experience for you but you have your own reasons and I dont know what they are for thinking this person isnt good for you Trust your gut instinct and be glad youve had this relationship Not all are meant to last But all shape you into the person you are and will become and all teach us important lessons
"voices in my head, hearing voices, not normal, fight the voices, want them to stop, been here so long, want them gone, make the voices stop",This isnt something you can do on your own If you havent already you need to see a medical doctor ASAP to rule out medical causes for this Many diseases illnesses and conditions can cause hallucinations In the elderly sometimes its something as simple as a urinary tract infection Some medicines may have that side effect as wellHowever you say youve been hearing them since you were little I have no idea how old you are now but something that has been going on for many years does lead me to think it could be a type of schizophrenia A psychiatrist could diagnose that after taking a complete look at your history medical history etc There are medications that they can put you on that will help One thing that I find encouraging is that you recognize youre hearing voices This means you are not so far into a delusion as to believe it is real A lot of people that hear or see things that arent there are not able to have the awareness that these things are not real They fully believe what theyre hearingseeing Its completely real to them Because you have the awareness that you do I feel this is a very good sign that with treatment you can live a normal life assuming you are not already receiving treatment for it If you are and are still hearing the voices please know that medications often need to be changed and adjusted and the voices may never completely go away but medicines certainly help dull them a lot Always talk to your doctor when it seems your symptoms are getting worse so that they can make the necessary medication adjustments for youIf at any time the voices are telling you to do something please go to an ER as this is an emergency Sometimes people hear voices telling them to harm themselves harm someone else or do other things that are against the law Do not try to deal with something like that on your own There are people who can help

"couple therapy sessions, nervous, shaky, normal, feeling",It is totally normal  you have a lot riding on this and youre invested Think about why you feel so shaky  is it something about the therapist or their style If so it would be a good idea to talk with them about it so you feel more at ease In any case bringing up your feelings about therapy in therapy is totally appropriate and even necessary Good luck
"listening to my husband, never listens to me, get my husband to listen to me, listening to him all the time",Have the two of you ever discussed how you feel  I know given the nature of your question thats probably not likely but Im going to suggest it any way  He needs to understand that how you feel about this issue equates to not being as happy in the relationship as you could be or he thinks you are  So start there that may be more of an attention getter than you never listen to me yes I do etc  Direct opener  Im not as happy in this relationship as I think we both deserve  Pause and if you wont let me talk about it then its only going to get worse  Then explain you dont feel listened to you try to be a good listener but you dont feel you are getting the same in return  If he interrupts put your hand up in the sign of a stop then say please just let me finish  You are right to raise this subject with him because a good marriage cant exist in a communication vacuum In fairness to him he needs to understand the seriousness of your concern and have a chance to do better  If he refuses  tell him you want to seek couples counseling then do it with him or without him
"sad, upset, dependent, helplessness, identity crisis",Recognizing that youre too dependent on your boyfriend can be a wakeup call and an excellent opportunity to work on your own personal growth and independence  It sounds like its time to explore and develop your own interests and engage in some activities that excite and challenge you  If you have time it could be useful to begin a new activity or class cultivate friendships outside of your relationship with your boyfriend and begin to reflect and meditate on ways to enhance your own personal fulfillment
"depressed, find someone to talk to",If there is no one in your life with whom you feel comfortable I would recommend identifying someone on this site psychology today or goodtherapyorg who is in your area then give that therapist a call to see if you would be a good match
"insecurities, hurting relationship, accepting past, hard time, accepting himself, accepting others, let go, live in the present",One of the sometimes difficult things about being in a relationship is the fact that you can make goals for yourself but you cant make goals for your partner If your fiancé wants to learn to live more in the present and learn to let go of the past or move in a different direction you can certainly assist him but you cant independently make it happenI wonder if both of you would be willing to have a discussion where he is able to explain to you what he is experiencing and you are able to listen for five 10 15 minutes in a way that is not blaming or pointing fingers or asking him to change but just listening kind of like an investigative reporter so you can have more details and ask questions that you may have about what certain things mean when it feels like to to him when this is discussed etc At that point maybe he would willing to listen to your thoughts on the subject as wellAlso if he wants to make a change it may be helpful to see a therapist who specializes in working with couples Sometimes changes such as these require a great deal of personal awareness and there can be quite a bit of emotions attached so it is often helpful to have someone there to assistIt may also be nice to have a discussion where you consider what makes you feel valued appreciated special or loved and also consider what makes your fiancé feel that way
"dad doesn't like, yells at me, extreme, over dramatic, depressed, asking me why, emotional abuse",Maybe this is emotional abuseIt certainly is irritating and annoying to be yelled at for being yourselfMaybe at a time when hes not yelling you can bring up the topic of your own willingness if this is true to discuss questions he has about your genderTheres no guarantee he wont start yelling midway through a dialogue like this  Only then you will be on firm ground to excuse yourself from the conversation since you already explained that youre willing to talk with him and not to be yelled at by him
"relationship, brief, good friends, upset, wrong",Its completely understandable that you would have male friends and that you would want to spend time with them  When you cross over from friends to a relationship it does change things  Some people are very easy going and wouldnt feel threatened by what you did  Others would be upset  If your boyfriend is upset by you spending time with this male friend then you need to talk about it  Each of you needs to express your feelings about the situation and listen to the other with patience and respect  Then you can make a decision on what is best for you and your relationship  Maybe he wouldnt be upset if you saw this friend while you were with your boyfriend  Or maybe your boyfriend would feel better if he got to know this person better and could trust him  Most likely you can come up with a situation that will make both of you comfortable going forward  You didnt do anything wrong because it doesnt sound like you intended to hurt your boyfriend  But if you really care about your boyfriend then you probably care about making him upset  Instead of looking at this issue as a problem try to look at it as an opportunity to connect  If you can both listen to each other and understand each other your relationship can become even closer
"emotions, attracted, bother, date, ask out, approach, hold back, secret, upfront, happy, continue",Keep doing the crossdressing since you like itYour problem sounds more a matter of timing and reason to tell the girl about itNot keeping a secret is a good attitude regarding meaningful parts of your life  Usually our relationship partner is someone whom we trust as a safe person to know all about usOnce you feel at ease with your potential partner then bring up your crossdressing  Based on their handling of this intimate part of your life you will know more as to whether or not you feel more or less drawn to themSecrets held within a relationship usually get worse with time   The person who feels unsafe in truly being and stating themselves eventually will end up feeling ashamed of parts of them which prior to the relationship felt good or at least not worrisome
"empty, feel nothing, stop feeling",Your question is very broad because feeling empty can develop for many different reasonsYoure certainly not alone in feeling this wayTry to follow the logic of your feelings by asking yourself questions about the empty feeling   Doing this may open up a discovery about the reason for the emptiness feelingWhen do you feel empty are there certain situations it happens more often than another what helps the feeling go away what or who is helpful in relieving the empty feelingSometimes people need a little help to get started in understanding how to recognize their feelingsConsider a therapist any disciplined practice which encourages selfknowledge such as some yoga practices and a creative discipline like photography or music As long as you concentrate on increasing your selfunderstanding eventually youll find the answer to your question
"illness, never go away, life will never change, feel alone, no one, pain, learn to be happy alone",Im so sorry youre feeling like things will never get better Try to remember that whatever illness you are dealing with you are not the only person to have dealt with it and you are not alone Out there just waiting for you is a group of people that will totally understand what youre going through and will be able to share how they coped Try searching for a support group for your illness  google and wwwpsychologytodaycom are both good places to start for those groups
"emotions, symptoms, situations, live with parents, cant afford, control my life",Youre among many millennials who live with their parents due to financial reasonsDoes your mother mean rules pertaining to the way your family household organizes its daily or does she mean something elseEvery household needs rules as responsibilities to keep the house clean who does the grocery shopping the way costs are distributed for this and all the other carrying charges  and tasks of maintaining the house in decent order as well as respecting the privacy and noise level requests of others who live in the homeThis set of responsibilities applies whenever more than one person lives with another personHave you tried simply telling your mom that youre willing to be a responsible household member and that you prefer to keep the details of the way you live the rest of your life to yourselfThis would show respect to your mom and start the discussion as to the areas of your life you feel deserve privacy and how you would like to handle when your right to run your own life overlaps with any household duties
"concerned, 12 year old daughter, walking on toes, coloring, writing messy, suddenly, never walked on tiptoes, colored and written neatly, advice",Have you asked your daughter why shes doing the behaviors you describeOften the best way to find out why someone does something is to simply ask them their reasonHer answer will give you some guidance as to next possible stepsIf shes pretending to be a fantasy figure or trying to find out how being taller feels or walking on high heels or some other image then knowing this rules out that she has some unbearable pain in her arch which may require more practical answers such as new shoes or even indicate a medical problemAsk if shes noticed any change in the way she walks   Maybe she doesnt know shes doing this and maybe she feels embarrassed to tell you shes doing something a bit oddSince usually 12 year olds dont color is it new that she started coloringMaybe given the fact of messy handwriting shes in a phase of pretending or reflecting on good times as a young childThen this becomes the topic of examinationDoes she feel insecure about being on the cusp of adolescenceSome of these questions can be asked directly and some are for you to first decide based on what you know of your daughter which questions and what direction to take in understanding your daughters motivation
"lost erection, frequent problem, major problems, ego, self esteem, depression, tearing apart marriage, devastated, cannot find cause, attracted to wife, express in bedroom",First step always is to do a medical rule out so that youre sure the problem is psychological and emotion based not a medical condition which requires care and attentionIf you are medically clear in the reasons for losing your erection then reflect on what may be creating a loss in confidence in either who you are and what youre doing with your life or whether your wife has these sort of problems within herselfOften a problem transfers ownership of who shows itIf you are a sensitive person its possible your erection problem reflects your wifes insecurities and selfdoubt  If she is someone who is reluctant to talk about feeling unsure then in a certain way by you showing a problem she can avoid looking at herselfThere may not be a direct cause such as usually exists in a medical problemMedicine looks for symptoms to treatOur emotional lives are much more indirectIf you feel stress at work or are unhappy in the place you live for example then your frustration may show up in your sex lifeBasically do a broad inward search of your life and what it holds and maybe ask your wife to do the sameYou may clear the air within yourselves and between each other so the problem goes away
"bullied, teachers, depression, sad, deal with, school, help",Thats a very difficult situation that you are in But you are not alone I have several schoolaged clients who find little to no assistance from their teachers at their schools regarding bullyingThere are a few options that are available to you to help deal with being bullied at school One option that I would suggest is for you to talk to your support network Friends and family can sometimes be good sources of support Another option would be to speak with us about your counselor if you have one And third there are some excellent online sources of support regarding the bullying at school wwwstopbullyingorg
"imposter syndrome, graduate school, phenomenal graduate student, well-published, well liked, feeling, found out as a fraud, get over, emotion, symptom, situation",It would be very helpful to identify with you eventual pattern where the imposter syndrome is more or less present Are there specific situations where youve noticed the feelings of Im going to be found out as a fraud becoming more strong It seems that shaking this feeling is very important to you In my opinion before shaking that feeling we need to get closer to it and understand its roots If you would like to get closer to the feeling you might consider asking yourself questions such What is the trigger for this feeling How does it feel in the body What is the thought process I engage with after noticing this feeling All the best Rossana Mag
"late teens, live with dad, college classes, see friends, want to talk, not want to talk, feel not worth knowing, never going to do anything right, depressed",Im alway wary of assigning a term to a feeling as often that term becomes more important than the feeling itself From the very little that you have written it is clear that you are going through something that has made you extremely low affected your selfesteem and motivation limits your enjoyment of formerly pleasurable activities and affects your feelings of selfworth All of these are aspects of being depressed though you can be depressed and still not have depression Counseling is definitely a place where you can go and sort out why you have had such a sudden a drastic change to your mood Sometimes our mood can be effected by changes in our routine losses or significant disappointments Talking with someone will not only help you to better understand why you are feeling this way but they will also help you to ground yourself and learn strategies and tools to help you to manage your mood and strategize for the future I do hope that you will reach out Feeling alone can be harmful over long periods of time as it can stop us from seeking out the support we need

"autism diagnosis, stopped working, take care, abusive relationship, mentally, physically, emotionally, recluse, nervous, feel comfortable, other people",Probably a good portion of living like a recluse was necessary so you had time to rest and recuperate from so much major adjustment in your lifeHave you told some of the people in your life about the many changes youve been through   It is possible people sense something different about you and arent sure whether to ask or not ask questionsAlso understand what type of qualities youd like to offer and receive in a friendship   Given that raising a kid who has autism takes a lot of energy and time the way you socialize will changeStart with one person whom youre pretty sure would welcome you and whom you would gain by bringing them into your lifeAs a result of how this interaction goes how you decide to spend your time together what youll discuss you will know more about yourself and what you require to feel good around other peopleThen you can consider if youre ready to add others into your world

"random thoughts, dont want, worth anything, wrong with me, stop having, these thoughts",Those  critical thoughts most likely came into your mind as the way you understood what one of your parents or some other adult who was very meaningful to you at a very young ageWhen we are too young to distinguish whether what a grown person tells us feels accurate we absorb their opinions as our ownYour question shows youve reached the point of emotional maturity to know that your opinion about yourself is not the same as what is inside your emotional brain and stored there since you were too young to know that someone elses opinions are not necessarily your opinionsNothing is wrong with you everything is right with you to wonder how to more firmly establish your own point of viewStart the habit to revise any viewpoints about yourself which dont feel trueThen replace these thoughts with better ones which you decide on your ownAfter a while of doing this youll either automatically think the more positive thoughts about yourself or at least be in the habit to know that negative viewpoints about you are not necessarily true

"fighting all the time, don't agree, jumps to conclusions, family-oriented, abused, ignored, messed up, mentally, forced out, mad, hate, bring me down, homeless, guidance, hit each other, dying, relationship healthy, advice",Hello It sounds to me like you are carrying an enormous amount of emotional weight and maybe even an equally enormous amount of guilt and feelings of failure about your marriage I cannot imagine how challenging this is for you right now Marriages take lots of work and often the only examples we tend to have are of those we saw when we were young  good bad or indifferent There are no easy answers to your questions and I wont presume that my response to you will be the linchpin that heals all your pain But I can maybe give some thoughts and reflections First and foremost cut yourself some slack No one is perfect We fail more often than we succeed but in the end we learn and that learning helps us grow Yes youre right the abusive aspects of your marriage are not good and need to stop You probably are doing more harm than good in that regard and this will quickly destroy anything you have in your marriage that is even remotely in your favor Seeing a therapist for yourself and then seeing a therapist as a couple is a good approach You have issues that you need to resolve that while they impact your marriage because they are part of the history of your life they are separate from your marriage in many respectsJoining a marriage support group can also be helpful You can find these through local counseling resources Sometimes your local crisis numbers can provide services in your area that can be helpful If you belong to a religious or spiritual community then you might see if there is any type of counseling offered for free or at a reduced rate Sometimes pastoral support is focused on the spiritual side of any issues addressed so if you feel this is important it might be a viable option for youLastly parents are imperfect Yepits true They had no more of a guaranteed parenting success manual than you do at having chances for a perfect marriage We limp along and do our best Having said that we can still take the best from our past and apply to our future no matter how small or insignificant it might be for us The bad stuff serves as lessons of what to avoid and we are each responsible and accountable for our actions in this life Both with ourselves and toward other people So this becomes a guiding principle in our actions It may be that you discover that the marriage you are in is not a good fit  I am sure that remains to be seen but either way you both must be involved in saving it If only one of you cares then 100 of the energy to salvage the marriage rests on the shoulders of one person Thats not fair So be sure you have a clear understanding from your wife about what she wants and work to create an amicable solution All of this said seek out supportive friends and actively work to do your part to make the changes you want to see in your life One way or the other you will benefit from itBe well
"boyfriends parents, unannounced visits, long periods of time, boundaries, opinionated, rude, pushy, unsolicited advice, child rearing, privacy, barges in, key, permission, address",Youre expecting reasonable behaviors from your boyfriends fatherSince the father is his your boyfriend is the person in position to speak directly with his dad about the expectations you and he have of the fatherIf your boyfriend has a good relationship w his dad which is not what this sounds like then greatIf your boyfriend has a stressed and tense relationship w his dad then somehow he needs to develop or be coached and encouraged by the people in his life who truly care about and know him a way to state the very reasonable standards you describe hereIf all else fails then a new living space is always another possibility
"combative, depression, unsupportive, uncomfortable, instigate conversations, arguments, understand",Your situation sounds extremely frustratingYoure doing the right move to state you dont want to discuss your depression with herI guess you could ask if she would like to know your reason to not speak w her about your depression  If you feel she can handle a reasonable conversation and you would like to tell her your true reason then schedule this or bring up the topic at a neutral time not in the middle of an argumentHaving an unsupportive mom is difficult enough to accept  You may feel greater success and peach of mind to meditate on accepting her lack of understanding than to engage in arguing when she starts this
"suicide attempts, terminally ill, died, abusive, foster care, long term effects, childhood history",The true answer is no one can really say with certaintyThe variables are the way this child absorbs and adjusts to these significant changes in their life  All anyone can do is guess at this point and theres no good reason to guessThe only general certainty is that the adult whom this child becomes will have had a profound encounter with the biggest types of human losses a child can go throughSome people become great teachers therapists and philosophers who have this background  Some give up on life and hide away from othersThe best anyone could do who knows this child is to offer love bc this is the greatest guarantee to show there are good people on this earth
